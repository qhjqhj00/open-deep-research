This article highlights nursing’s efforts to facilitate the growth of the research culture by developing theory, establishing the importance of a research-based practice, advancing education, and providing avenues for dissemination of research. Similarities with the chiropractic profession are discussed, along with a commentary by Cheryl Hawk, D.C, Ph.D.\n\n**Keywords:** Nursing education, Nursing research, Nursing theory, Research culture, Research dissemination\n\nEVOLUTION OF NURSING RESEARCH\n-----------\n\nThe development of a research culture in nursing in many ways parallels that of chiropractic, and by reviewing key aspects of the evolution of the science of nursing, there are lessons to be learned, and mistakes to be avoided. Nursing research has changed dramatically in the past 150 years, beginning with Florence Nightingale in the 19th century. Clearly, nursing research has not always had the influence and significance it holds today. In fact, for a number of years after Nightingale’s work, little is found in the literature concerning nursing research. This is perhaps due to the past perception of nursing as an apprenticeship in a task-oriented caring profession ([1]). Although research was conducted with respect to nursing education and administration in the first half of the 20th century, it was not until the 1950s that nursing research began the advancement that has been seen in the past three decades. This is due to many factors: an increase in the number of nurses with advanced academic preparation, the establishment of vehicles for dissemination of nursing research, federal funding and support for nursing research, and the upgrading of research skills in faculty and students. This article provides a brief review of the development of research in nursing, and along with it, the theory that has guided that process.\n\nNURSING THEORY DEVELOPMENT\n----------\n\nAs with other practice professions, nursing requires a knowledge foundation that is based on theory and derived from systematic research. The first nursing theorist, Florence Nightingale, created detailed reports of both medical and nursing matters as chief nurse for the British in the Crimean War in the mid-1850s. Nightingale noted that “… apprehension, uncertainty, waiting, expectation, fear of surprise, do a patient more harm than any exertion” (p. 6) ([2]). As a result, Nightingale’s conceptualization of nursing included the need to have an understanding of the laws of nature, the prevention of disease, and the use of personal power. She viewed persons as both physical and spiritual beings, emphasizing the importance of the environment and the need to care for the patient, not the disease. With her emphasis on the environment, changes in nutrition, hydration, and sanitation resulted, and mortality rates dropped drastically during the Crimean War ([3]). In subsequent years, Nightingale developed “laws of nursing” that formed the basis for nursing science and guided nursing education in the United States from 1850 to the 1950s ([4]).\n\nIn the 1960s, nursing theory was used to guide teaching rather than research or practice. This was a natural outgrowth of nursing’s earlier focus on education and professional identity. Additionally, the National League for Nursing (the professional accrediting body) stipulated a conceptual framework for curriculum. Paradigmatic concepts integral to nursing were identified as _person, environment, health_, and _nursing_ ([5]–[7]), and scientific energies were spent developing curriculum that corresponded to existing theories ([7]). At this point in time, nurse educators began to urge students to “care for the whole person” and textbooks underscored the importance of “holism” in nursing, with subtitles such as “The Biopsychosocial Approach.” Nurse authors acknowledged multiple causality in human illness, but all too often research, curricula, and textbooks reflected linear cause-and-effect models rather than multivariate approaches.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the development of theories explaining the art and science of nursing. Hildegard Peplau published _Interpersonal Relations in Nursing_ ([8]) in 1952, based on her work as a psychiatric nurse. Other theories. included Levine’s _Conservation Principles of Nursing_ ([9]) in, 1967; Roger’s _Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing_ ([10]) in 1970, and _The Science of Unitary Man_ ([11]) in 1980, followed by _The Science of Unitary Human Beings, a Paradigm for Nursing_ ([12]) in 1983. Imogene King published A _Theory for Nursing: Systems, Concepts, Process_ ([13]) in 1981, and Sister Calista Roy published her adaptation model ([14]) in 1980. These “grand” theories were complex and key concepts were hard to measure empirically. Thus it was difficult to test these early nursing theories through research. With the emphasis on clinical nursing research, the recent trend has been to develop and test midrange theories that describe patient problems and nursing practice.\n\nNURSING RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT\n----------\n\nIn 1859, Nightingale used the battlefield hospitals of the Crimean War as her research laboratory, using an epidemiological process to describe the morbidity and mortality of sick and injured soldiers. Her pioneering epidemiological research and statistical methodology (documenting the relationship between the environment and health status of soldiers) was the hallmark of scientific investigation in nursing ([4],[15]).\n\nAn historical review from 1900 to 1949 reveals that nursing research in the United States (see [Table 1]) was in its infancy, focusing on nursing education, nurses, nursing students, and ways to organize nurses’ work. As noted earlier, at this time, nursing theory was discussed solely as a means of developing and organizing educational curriculum. Early educators were unable to develop educational programs that both represented a nursing perspective and helped students focus on nursing concepts and problems rather than medical concepts and problems. In the first half of this century, groups were formed to answer such questions as: what is nursing, what do nurses do, and how unique is nursing from other health science disciplines? Professional debates raged as to whether nursing was merely a “poor stepsister” of medicine or whether it was part of the biological, natural, or physical sciences ([4]). Research during this period was essentially nonexistent in terms of nursing practice.\n\n### TABLE 1.\n\nNursing: Historical Developments in Nursing Theory and Research\n\n \n| Date | Development |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| 1850 | Florence Nightingale: first nurse researcher; first nurse theorist |\n| Late 1800s–1900 | ‘Dark Ages’ |\n| Nursing viewed as an apprenticeship |\n| Little focus on research-based practice |\n| 1900–1949 | _American Journal of Nursing_ (AJN) published |\n| Research focus: nursing education and administration |\n| Questions: What is nursing?

Historically, nurses searched for single causative agents when promoting health or preventing illness, even as they acknowledged the contributions of multiple other factors. Predominant modes of inquiry relied on early in the development of a culture of nursing research were empirical (logical positivist). Nurse researchers modeled themselves after colleagues in the basic and biomedical sciences, perhaps in an effort to seek scientific validation. Only during the 1980s and 1990s did nurses increasingly use qualitative research methods, such as phenomenology and ethnography, to explain complex human phenomena. Therefore, nurse researchers are just beginning to respond to the need to view human problems in less reductionistic terms when the research questions call for a holistic combination of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies ([16]). Over the past two decades, many nurses have pursued further education, consultation, or research to enhance their understanding and ability to respond constructively to patient behavior. For example, by the mid-1980s, there was a sizable increase in nursing studies of individuals and families experiencing developmental, environmental, or illness-generated crisis situations involving both acute and long-term stress responses ([17]–[20]).\n\nDuring the 1990s, nursing practice underwent a clinical revolution in response to societal, medical, scientific, and technologic advances. Changes in nursing practice began to result from nursing research (e.g., research-based practice guidelines) as the efforts of individuals both in and outside of nursing (e.g., National Academy of Science, National Institute for Nursing Research, and major foundations) coalesced to stimulate and support clinical nursing research. Concurrently, there was a new surge of interest among nurses themselves in redefining the problems of their practice and delineating the gaps in knowledge underpinning their practice base. As noted earlier, the current decade has been marked by interest in multiple modes of inquiry (qualitative and quantitative) for a practice discipline which must address complex human phenomena. In the past, the type of research questions most often addressed through nursing research were of a descriptive or exploratory nature. However, nurse researchers are now going beyond “what is” and “how” questions and are addressing more explanatory or predictive-level questions using methodologically rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental designs as they redefine clinical problems and systematically address gaps in their knowledge base. After becoming established in the research arena, nursing researchers have expanded to incorporate and collaborate on interdisciplinary studies, health care systems and health services research, and taxonomies such as Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC) ([21]) and Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) ([22]). The taxonomies represent efforts to define what nurses do and outcomes sensitive to nursing interventions.\n\nThe culture of nursing research has now advanced to the point where consideration can be given not just to the conduct of research, but also to its application in practice. The conduct of research is not the end, but rather a means through which practice is improved by utilizing research findings. Research utilization is the process of conveying and applying research-based knowledge to impact or change existing practices in the health care system ([23]). The primary components of research utilization involve summarizing knowledge generated through research; imparting the research knowledge to nurses, other health professionals, policymakers, and consumers of health care; and accomplishing desired outcomes for patients, their families, and health care providers and agencies. Models for research utilization were developed in the 1970s, beginning with the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education in Nursing (WCHEN) Regional Program for Nursing Development ([24]). Other models include the Conduct and Utilization of Research in Nursing (CURN) project ([25]), the Stetler/Marram model ([26]), the retrieval and application of research in nursing (RARIN) model ([27]) and the Iowa model of research in practice ([28]). The primary goal of research utilization programs is to make research findings an integral part of nursing practice, assuring research-based care delivery models. Research utilization is an excellent model for application of research findings to practice by advanced practice nurses.\n\nAn important trend is the use of research findings to serve as the basis for treatment decision making called evidence-based practice ([29]). Using this process, a question involving treatment is developed, and determination of the adequacy of current research is made. If the research base is adequate, it is synthesized, protocols are developed and applied, and evaluation is completed. Through these efforts, the nursing profession, in partnership with other professions, bridges the gap between research and practice to improve patient care.\n\nEDUCATIONAL ADVANCEMENT\n---------\n\nEarly nursing education took place in hospital training programs (nursing diploma), modeled on Florence Nightingale’s work in the United Kingdom ([30]). In 1915, nursing’s educational accrediting body, the National League for Nursing (NLN) called for university-level education. Baccalaureate programs in nursing emerged in 1923 at Yale University and Western Reserve University, but the majority of nursing education took place in hospital-based diploma programs. In 1971, the first community college programs for nursing education opened, providing graduates with an associate degree in nursing. Today, entry into nursing practice takes place primarily in associate degree programs, with baccalaureate programs second. Gradually, diploma programs have decreased in number, and few exist today. Associate degree programs may introduce nursing students to research, but baccalaureate programs included nursing research in the upper division curriculum. From 1900 to the 1960s, most nursing leaders obtained their graduate-level preparation in schools of education ([30]). For many years, the Master’s degree was considered the terminal degree in nursing.\n\nThe number of nurses whose career was devoted to research was miniscule in the 1960s. Indeed, even by the 1970s only about 400 nurses in the United States held a doctoral degree ([31]). In 1955, the Nursing Research Grants and Fellowship Program of the Division of Nursing, United States Public Health Service (USPHS) was established. This program awarded grants for nursing research projects, nursing research fellowships, and nurse-scientist graduate training ([32]). Early funding was for nurses to obtain their doctorates in fields _outside_ of nursing, because there were no nursing doctoral programs available. As a result, nurse-physiologists, nurse-anthropologists, and so forth emerged in the field. They were educated to conduct research, but often stayed in the field of their doctorate and did not apply their research efforts to nursing care problems.The emphasis during this period continued to be on establishing nursing’s rightful place in the academic setting of the university. As nursing became integrated into university life during the 1970s, nursing faculty became aware of their responsibility to develop new knowledge, and in many university-based schools of nursing, faculty members began to prepare both themselves and their students to become investigators ([33]).\n\nCurrently, three types of doctoral degrees in nursing are available. A Nursing Doctorate (ND), first established at Case Western Reserve University in 1979, was designed to be equivalent to the Doctor of Medicine degree, providing students preparation for the practice of generalized nursing and future leadership, but not for advanced practice. Professional doctorates, Doctor of Nursing Science (DNS, DNSc, DSN), emphasized advanced clinical, administrative, or policy-related practice and leadership. The Doctor of Nursing Science degree focuses on applied rather than basic research, and on applying and testing new knowledge in practice. Although the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) was first available to nurses at Teachers College at Columbia University in the 1920s, interest in doctoral education was rekindled in the 1970s. The number of doctoral programs in nursing has increased from zero in the 1950s to over 65 institutions, three-fourths of which are academic doctorates (PhD) that prepare graduates for a lifetime of scholarship and research ([34]). More recently, nurses in academic settings have been encouraged to obtain postdoctoral research training with support available through both individual (F32) and institutional (T32) traineeships through the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nRESEARCH FUNDING AND SUPPORT\n----------\n\nSeveral factors stimulated the growth of nursing research in the 1980s and 1990s. Perhaps the most important factor was the creation in 1986 of the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR) in the United States Public Health Service (USPHS). The development of this Center resulted from intense political action by the American Nurses’ Association (ANA) ([23]). The primary aim of the NCNR was “the conduct, support, and dissemination of information regarding basic and clinical nursing research, training and other programs in patient care research” (p. 2) ([35]). Prior to the establishment of the NCNR, most of the federal funds supporting research were designated for medical studies that concentrated on the diagnosis and cure of disease. Thus, creation of the NCNR was a major achievement for nurse researchers. In 1993, the NCNR became the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), strengthening nursing’s position by giving the Center institute status within the NIH. This advance served to put nursing into the mainstream of research activities and on more equal status with scientists and other health professions. With the establishment of the Center and then the Institute, federal funding for nursing research has grown. In 1986, the NCNR had a budget of $16.2 million. In 1996, the budget for the NINR was about $55 million ([1]), more than a threefold increase over a decade. The NINR elected to foster five research priorities for 1995 through 1999: community-based nursing models, effectiveness of nursing interventions in HIV/AIDS, cognitive impairment, living with chronic illness, and biobehavioral factors related to immunocompetence ([22]).\n\nThe NINR’s strategic plan for the next millenium includes funding nursing research on chronic illnesses (e.g., improving adherence to chemotherapy, pain relief), quality and cost effectiveness of care, health promotion and disease prevention, management of symptoms (e.g., gender differences in response to therapeutics, managing the pain cycle), health disparities (e.g., cultural sensitivity), adaptation to new technologies (e.g., transplants), and palliative care at the end of life. Special allocations and Requests for Applications (RFA) have facilitated research in these target areas, although investigator-initiated research topics are funded if they are significant to nursing or patient care. The projected budget for NINR for the year 2000 is over $70 million, which is approximately distributed as follows: 73% for extramural research project grants; 8% for pre- and postdoctoral training; 3.5% for career development; 3.5% for Core Centers in specialized areas of research inquiry; 3% for the intramural program. Planning research for the next 5 years and into the next century is a welcome challenge for the NINR and the scientific community ([36]).\n\nRESEARCH DISSEMINATION\n--------\n\nSignificant milestones in the development of nursing science began in the mid-1950s (see [Table 1]). From 1950 to 1959, there was growing emphasis on the need to identify a body of knowledge for the developing profession of nursing in order to justify its presence in post-World War II universities ([37]). Not only was the first journal of _Nursing Research_ established in 1952; several textbooks related to nursing research were also published. Another critical step in the evolution of the culture of nursing science was the establishment of the American Nurses Foundation by the American Nurses Association specifically to promote nursing research. During the 1950s, regional research conferences were instituted for the first time, and federal support of nursing research began ([4],[33],[37]). All these elements were essential to the development of a science of nursing.\n\nSeveral new nursing research journals, including _Applied Nursing Research_ (ANR), were instituted in the late 1980s. _ANR_ publishes research reports of special significance to nurse clinicians ([1]). Increasingly, clinical specialty (i.e., _Heart and Lung, Journal of Gerontological Nursing_) journals are publishing data-based articles as well.\n\nAnother important event in the development and dissemination of nursing theory and research was the creation of the _Annual Review of Nursing Research_ in 1983. This publication includes critical analyses of research pertinent to nursing and health, including nursing practice, nursing care delivery, nursing education, and the nursing profession. Chapters systematically assess knowledge development in nursing, encourage the use of research findings in practice, and provide direction for future research ([22]). More recently, scholars have joined to create the _Encyclopedia of Nursing Research_ ([38]), a publication that provides a comprehensive overview of research studies, the history of nursing research, and the evolution of theory development in nursing.\n\nCONCLUSION\n----\n\nThe next century challenges nursing research with critical imperatives for improving health care. Changes in our nation’s population and their needs and expectations will impact the direction of nursing research. Consumers are becoming more involved in managing their own health care, and practitioners are continually adjusting to new technologies as well as innovative health care systems. The broad spectrum of nursing research encompasses both clinical and basic investigations with the patient as the central focus. Nursing must concentrate on making certain that our valuable scientific findings are incorporated into practice and focus on developing the next generation of nurse researchers ([36]).\n\nThe research culture in chiropractic is similar to where nursing research was in its early years. To move chiropractic research forward will require many of the same changes that occurred in nursing, such as educational advancement, collaboration in academic settings, federal acknowledgement and support, and development of more avenues for research dissemination to practitioners. Just as nursing had to overcome significant barriers such as attitudes and low educational and professional status, so, too, will the chiropractic profession have to strive to develop a research tradition in order to integrate research as part of its practice culture.\n\nREFERENCES\n----\n\n* 1.Polit DF, Hungler BP.

            "content": "The evolution of nursing research is marked by significant developments that span over 150 years, beginning with the foundational contributions of Florence Nightingale in the 1850s. This historical trajectory provides insight into how nursing research has transitioned from a nascent stage to a well-supported discipline that influences healthcare practices today.\n\n## Historical Context of Nursing Research\n\nHistorically, nursing was mostly seen as an apprenticeship focused on practical skills rather than a research-based profession. Nightingale’s work during the Crimean War laid the groundwork for nursing research by employing statistical methods to analyze the environmental factors affecting health outcomes. However, it wasn't until the 1950s that nursing research began to gain traction, facilitated by an increase in nurses with advanced academic qualifications and the establishment of dedicated journals and funding sources for nursing research.\n\n## Development of Nursing Theory\n\nThe evolution of nursing research includes the progression of nursing theory, which plays a crucial role in providing a systematic framework for practice. Nightingale herself was the first nurse theorist, proposing that nursing should focus on the patient’s environment as a means of fostering healing. Throughout the 20th century, various theorists developed frameworks that merged the art and science of nursing, yet early theories often displayed complexity that hindered empirical measurement. Over time, the focus shifted towards midrange theories that adequately describe patient issues and guide practice.\n\n## Advances in Nursing Research\n\nBy the 1980s, a concerted effort was made to expand nursing research beyond descriptive studies towards more rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Important milestones included the establishment of the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR) in 1986, which was later upgraded to the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR). This institutional support dramatically increased federal funding for nursing research, which subsequently grew from $16.2 million in 1986 to approximately $55 million by the late 1990s.\n\n## Educational Progression and Funding\n\nAs nursing education transitioned from hospital-based diploma programs to accredited university degrees, the number of nurses pursuing graduate education also increased. Doctoral programs in nursing emerged, fostering a generation of researchers dedicated to advancing the discipline. The NINR’s strategic priorities have emphasized areas such as chronic illness, health disparities, and effective patient care interventions, which directly inform evidence-based practices within nursing.\n\n## Implications for Practice\n\nThe evolution of nursing research has aimed to bridge the gap between research findings and their application in clinical settings. Models for research utilization have developed over the years to facilitate the incorporation of research into everyday practice, enhancing patient care through evidence-based protocols"

This is the first review of deep learning in RCC applications. This review aims to show that deep learning technologies hold great promise in the field of RCC diagnosis, and we look forward to more research results to meet us for the mutual benefit of renal cell carcinoma patients. Medical imaging plays an important role in the early detection of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of RCC during treatment. The most commonly used technologies such as contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT), ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are now digitalized, allowing deep learning to be applied to them. Deep learning is one of the fastest growing fields in the direction of medical imaging, with rapidly emerging applications that have changed the traditional medical treatment paradigm. With the help of deep learning-based medical imaging tools, clinicians can diagnose and evaluate renal tumors more accurately and quickly. This paper describes the application of deep learning-based imaging techniques in RCC assessment and provides a comprehensive review.\n\n**Keywords:** artificial intelligence; carcinoma; deep learning; imaging diagnosis; prediction model.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Wang, Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Xu, Jiao and Niu.\n\n[PubMed Disclaimer]\n\nConflict of interest statement\n----------\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nFigures\n---\n\n [![Image 7: Figure 1]] \n\n**Figure 1\n\n**\n\nThe flowchart and application overview…\n\n**Figure 1\n\n**\n\nThe flowchart and application overview of deep learning research.

            "content": "Deep learning techniques have emerged as a transformative force in the imaging diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of detection and evaluation processes. A recent comprehensive review highlights both current applications and future trends in this rapidly evolving field.\n\n## Current Achievements in Deep Learning for RCC Diagnosis\n\nDeep learning has been applied to various imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These technologies have been digitalized, enabling the integration of advanced algorithms that can analyze vast datasets much faster than traditional methods. The applications of deep learning in this context have improved the detection of renal tumors, leading to better clinical decisions.\n\nThe study underscores that deep learning tools can assist clinicians in diagnosing and evaluating renal tumors with enhanced precision and speed. Such tools have the potential to process and learn from diverse data inputs, including imaging, pathology, and genomic information. With robust models trained on comprehensive datasets, these techniques can predict various parameters of RCC, such as pathology type and prognosis, helping inform treatment strategies for patients[1].\n\n## Emerging Trends and Future Research Directions\n\nThe review calls attention to ongoing challenges, including the need for more extensive datasets to improve model training and validation. Future research aims to refine these deep learning applications, focusing on enhancing their accuracy and generalizability across different patient populations and imaging settings. There is a growing interest in exploring how emerging technologies like radiomics, which extracts quantitative features from medical images, can be synergistically combined with deep learning approaches to further enhance diagnostic capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, as the field progresses, the integration of artificial intelligence in RCC diagnostics is expected to foster collaborative environments where radiologists and machine-learning algorithms work together, promoting better health outcomes for patients.\n\nOverall, the review establishes that deep learning technologies hold great promise in the field of RCC diagnosis, paving the way for innovative models and methodologies that can significantly impact patient care[1]."

In the past, three versions of Essentials were published: \n\nThe Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice , last published in \n\n2008; The Essentials of Master’s Education in Nursing , last published in 2011; and The Essentials of Doctoral Education for Advanced Nursing Practice , last published in 2006. Each of these documents has provided specific guidance for the development and revision of nursing curricula at a specific degree level. Given changes in higher education, learner expectations, and the rapidly evolving healthcare system outlined in AACN’s Vision for Academic Nursing (2019), new thinking and new approaches to nursing education are needed to prepare the nursing workforce of the future. \n\nThe Essentials: Core Competencies for Professional Nursing Education provides a framework for preparing individuals as members of the discipline of nursing, reflecting expectations across the trajectory of nursing education and applied experience. In this document competencies for professional nursing practice are made explicit. These Essentials introduce 10 domains that represent the essence of professional nursing practice and the expected competencies for each domain (see page 26). The domains and competencies exemplify the uniqueness of nursing as a profession and reflect the diversity of practice settings yet share common language that is understandable across healthcare professions and by employers, learners, faculty, and the public. The competencies accompanying each domain are designed to be applicable across four spheres of care (disease prevention/promotion of health and wellbeing, chronic disease care, regenerative or restorative care, and hospice/palliative/supportive care), across the lifespan, and with diverse patient populations. While the domains and competencies are identical for both entry and advanced levels of education, the sub-competencies build from entry into professional nursing practice to advanced levels of knowledge and practice. The intent is that any curricular model should lead to the ability of the learner to achieve the competencies. The \n\nEssentials also feature eight concepts that are central to professional nursing practice and are integrated within and across the domains and competencies. Because this document has been shared with practice partners and with other nursing colleagues, the Essentials serve to bridge the gap between education and practice. The core competencies are informed by the expanse of higher education, nursing education, nursing as a discipline, and a breadth of knowledge. The core competencies also are informed by the lived experiences of those deeply entrenched in various areas where nurses practice and the synthesis of knowledge and action intersect. The collective understanding allows all nurses to have a shared vision; promotes open discourse and exchange about nursing practice; and expresses a unified voice that represents the nursing profession. This introduction provides an overview of the evolution of nursing as a discipline, critical aspects of the profession that serve as a framework, and sufficient depth to inform nursing education across the educational trajectory (entry into practice through advanced education). © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

The emergence of nursing as a discipline had its earliest roots in Florence Nightingale’s thoughts about the nature of nursing. Believing nursing to be both a science and an art, she conceptualized the whole patient (mind, body, and spirit) as the center of nursing’s focus. The influence of the environment on an individual’s health and recovery was of utmost importance. The concepts of health, healing, well-being, and the interconnectedness with the multidimensional environment also were noted in her work. Although Nightingale did not use the word “caring” explicitly, the concept of care and a commitment to others were evident through her actions (Dunphy, 2015). In the same era of Florence Nightingale, nurse pioneer Mary Seacole was devoted to healing the wounded during the Crimean war. Following Nightingale, the nursing profession underwent a period of disorganization and confusion as it began to define itself as a distinct scientific discipline. Early nursing leaders (including Mary Eliza Mahoney, Effie Taylor, Annie Goodrich, Agatha Hodgins, Esther Lucille Brown, and Loretta Ford) sought to define the functions of the nurse (Gunn, 1991; Keeling, Hehman, & Kirchgessner, 2017). Other leaders devoted their efforts to addressing discrimination, advancing policies, and creating a collective voice for the profession. It would be difficult to gain an understanding of this period of the profession’s development without considering the work of Lavinia Dock, Estelle Osborne, Mary Elizabeth Carnegie, Ildaura Murillo-Rohde, and many other fearless champions. Contemporary nursing as it is practiced today began to take shape as a discipline in the 1970s and 1980s. Leaders of this era shared the belief that the discipline of nursing was the study of the well-being patterning of human behavior and the constant interaction with the environment, including relationships with others, health, and the nurse (Rogers, 1970; Donaldson & Crowley, 1978; Fawcett, 1984; Chinn & Kramer 1983, 2018; Chinn, 2019; Roy & Jones, 2007). The concept of caring also was described as the defining attribute of the nursing discipline (Leininger, 1978; Watson, 1985). Newman (1991) spoke to the need to sharpen the focus of the discipline of nursing to better define its social relevance and the nature of its service. Newman, Smith, Pharris, and Jones (2008) affirmed caring as the focus of the discipline, suggesting that relationships were the unifying construct. Smith and Parker (2010) later posited that relationships were built on partnership, presence, and shared meaning. In a historical analysis of literature on the discipline of nursing, five concepts emerged as defining the discipline: human wholeness; health; healing and well-being; environment-health relationship; and caring. When practicing from a holistic perspective, nurses understand the © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Smith purports that if nursing is to retain its status as a discipline, the explicit disciplinary knowledge must be an integral part of all levels of nursing. Nursing has its own science, and this body of knowledge is foundational for the next generation (Smith, 2019, p.13). Why consider the past in a document that strives to shape the future? The historical roots of the profession help its members understand how the past has answered complex questions and shapes vital discipline concepts, traditions, policies, and even relationships. D’Antonio, et. al (2010) also emphasize the disciplinary insights gained by considering the different histories that challenge the dominant and accepted historical narrative. Undoubtedly, many experts have contributed to the development of the discipline as it exists today. While the work of early and current theorists is extensive, Green (2018) notes that none have been accepted as completely defining the nature of nursing as a discipline. No doubt, nursing as a discipline will continue to evolve as society and health care evolves. \n\nAdvancing the Discipline of Nursing \n\nThe continued development of nursing as a unique discipline requires an intentional approach. Jairath et. al (2018) stated that any further development of the discipline should have the capacity to directly transform the patient’s health experience. A new social order may be necessary in which scientists, theorists, and practitioners work together to address questions related to the interplay of big data and nursing theory. Nursing graduates, particularly at the advanced nursing practice level, must be well-prepared to think ethically, conceptually, and theoretically to better inform nursing care. Students must not only be introduced to the knowledge and values of the discipline, but they must be guided to practice from a disciplinary perspective – by seeing patients through the lens of wholeness and interconnectedness with family and community; appreciating how the social, political, and economic environment influences health; attending to what is most important to well-being; developing a caring-healing relationship; and honoring personal dignity, choice, and meaning. Smith and McCarthy (2010) spoke to the need to provide a foundation for practitioners in the knowledge of the discipline. Without this knowledge, the persistent challenge of differentiating nursing and the professional levels of practice will continue. Knowledge of the discipline grows in graduate education, as students apply and generate nursing knowledge in their advanced nursing roles or develop and test theories as researchers. Nursing practice should be guided by a nursing perspective while functioning within an interdisciplinary arena. To appropriately educate the next generation of nurses, disciplinary knowledge must be leveled to reflect the competencies or roles expected at each level. \n\nThe Value of a Liberal Education \n\nIn higher education, every academic discipline is grounded in a unique body of knowledge that distinguishes that discipline. Through the study of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, students develop the capacity to engage in socially valued work and civic leadership in society. Liberal education exposes students to a broad worldview, multiple disciplines, and ways of knowing through specific coursework; however, the richness of perspective and knowledge is woven throughout the nursing curriculum as these are integral to the full scope of nursing © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Successful integration of liberal and nursing education provides graduates with knowledge of human cultures, including spiritual beliefs, as well as the physical and natural worlds supporting an approach to practice. The study of history, critical race theories, critical theories of nursing, critical digital studies, planetary health and climate science, politics, public policies, policy formation, fine arts, literature, languages, and the behavioral, biological, and natural sciences are key to the understanding of one’s self and others, civil readiness, and engagement and forms the basis for clinical reasoning and subsequent clinical judgments. A liberal education creates the foundation for intellectual and practical abilities within the context of nursing practice as well as for engagement with the larger community, locally and globally. A hallmark of liberal education is the development of a personal value system that includes the ability to act ethically regardless of the situation and where students are encouraged to define meaningful personal and professional goals with a commitment to integrity, equity, and social justice. Liberally educated graduates are well prepared to integrate knowledge, skills, and values from the arts, sciences, and humanities to provide safe, quality care; advocate for patients, families, communities, and populations; and promote health equity and social justice. Equally important, nursing education needs to ensure an understanding of the intersection of bias, structural racism, and social determinants with healthcare inequities and promote a call to action. \n\nCompetency-Based Education \n\nCompetency-based education is a process whereby students are held accountable to the mastery of competencies deemed critical for an area of study. Competency-based education is inherently anchored to the outputs of an educational experience versus the inputs of the educational environment and system. Students are the center of the learning experience, and performance expectations are clearly delineated along all pathways of education and practice. Across the health professions, curriculum, course work, and practice experiences are designed to promote responsible learning and assure the development of competencies that are reliably demonstrated and transferable across settings. By consistently assessing their own performance, students develop the ability to reflect on their own progress towards the achievement of learning goals and the ongoing attainment of competencies required for practice. Advances in learning approaches and technologies, understanding of evolving student learning styles and preferences, and the move to outcome-driven education and assessment all point to a transition to competency-based education. This learning approach is linked to explicitly defined performance expectations, based on observable behavior, and requires frequent assessment using diverse methodologies and formats. Designed in this fashion, competency-based education produces learning and behavior that endures, since it encourages conscious connections between knowledge and action. Learners who put knowledge into action grasp the interrelatedness of their learning with both theoretical perspectives and the world of their professional work. Achieving a specific competency gives meaning to the theoretical and assists in understanding and taking on a professional identity. Further, today’s students increasingly are taking responsibility for their own learning and, varied as they are in age and experience, respond to active learning strategies. Active learning involves © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Active learning requires clear information regarding what is to be learned, including guided practice in using that information to achieve a competency. It also requires regular assessment of progress towards mastery of the competency and frequent feedback on successes and areas needing development. Additionally, students must learn how to assess their own performances to develop the skill of continual self-reflection in their own practice. Stakeholders (employers, students, and the public) expect all nursing graduates to exit their education programs with defined and observable skills and knowledge. Employers desire assurance that graduates have expected competencies—the ability “to know” and also “to do” based on current knowledge. Moving to a competency-based model fosters intentionality of learning by defining domains, associated competencies, and performance indicators for those competencies. Currently, there is wide variability in graduate capabilities. Therefore, there is a need for consistency enabled by a competency-based approach to nursing education. A standard set of definitions frame competency-based education in the health professions and was adopted for these Essentials. Adoption of common definitions allows multiple stakeholders involved in health education and practice to share much of the same language. These definitions are included in the glossary (p. 59). \n\n## Nursing Education for the 21 st Century \n\nIn addition to the foundational elements on which the Essentials has been developed, other factors have served as design influencers. What does the nursing workforce need to look like for the future, and how do nursing education programs prepare graduates to be “work ready”? Nursing education for the 21 st century ought to reflect a number of contemporary trends and values and address several issues to shape the future workforce, including diversity, equity, and inclusion; four spheres of care (including an enhanced focus on primary care); systems-based practice; informatics and technology; academic-practice partnerships; and career-long learning. \n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion \n\nShifting U.S. population demographics, health workforce shortages, and persistent health inequities necessitate the preparation of nurses able to address systemic racism and pervasive inequities in health care. The existing inequitable distribution of the nursing workforce across the United States, particularly in underserved urban and rural areas, impacts access to healthcare services across the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention, to chronic disease management, to restorative and supportive care. Diversity, equity, and inclusion—as a value—supports nursing workforce development to prepare graduates who contribute to the improvement of access and care quality for underrepresented and medically underserved populations (AACN, 2019). Diversity, equity, and inclusion require intentionality, an institutional structure of social justice, and individually concerted efforts. The integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion in this Essentials document moves away from an isolated focus on these critical concepts. Instead, these concepts, defined in competencies, are fully represented and deeply integrated throughout the domains and expected in learning experiences across curricula. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 6THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nMaking nursing education equitable and inclusive requires actively combating structural racism, discrimination, systemic inequity, exclusion, and bias. Holistic admission reviews are recommended to enhance the admission of a more diverse student population to the profession (AACN, 2020). Additionally, an equitable and inclusive learning environment will support the recruitment, retention, and graduation of nursing students from disadvantaged and diverse backgrounds. Diverse and inclusive environments allow examination of any implicit or explicit biases, which can undermine efforts to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion. When diversity is integrated within inclusive educational environments with equitable systems in place, biases are examined, assumptions are challenged, critical conversations are engaged, perspectives are broadened, civil readiness and engagement are enhanced, and socialization occurs. These environments recognize the value of and need for diversity, equity, and inclusion to achieve excellence in teaching, learning, research, scholarship, service, and practice. Academic nursing must address structural racism, systemic inequity, and discrimination in how nurses are prepared. Nurse educators are called to critically evaluate policies, processes, curricula, and structures for homogeneity, classism, color-blindness, and non-inclusive environments. Evidence-based, institution-wide approaches focused on equity in student learning and catalyzing culture shifts in the academy are fundamental to eliminating structural racism in higher education (Barber et al., 2020). Only through deconstructive processes can academic nursing prepare graduates who provide high quality, equitable, and culturally competent health care. Finally, nurses should learn to engage in ongoing personal development towards understanding their own conscious and unconscious biases. Then, acting as stewards of the profession, they can fulfill their responsibility to influence both nursing and societal attitudes and behaviors toward eradicating structural/systemic racism and discrimination and promoting social justice. \n\nFour Spheres of Care \n\nHistorically, nursing education has emphasized clinical education in acute care. Looking at current and future needs, it is becoming increasingly evident that the future of healthcare delivery will occur within four spheres of care: 1) disease prevention/promotion of health and well-being, which includes the promotion of physical and mental health in all patients as well as management of minor acute and intermittent care needs of generally healthy patients; 2) chronic disease care, which includes management of chronic diseases and prevention of negative sequelae; 3) regenerative or restorative care, which includes critical/trauma care, complex acute care, acute exacerbations of chronic conditions, and treatment of physiologically unstable patients that generally requires care in a mega-acute care institution; and 4) hospice/ palliative/supportive care, which includes end-of-life care as well as palliative and supportive care for individuals requiring extended care, those with complex, chronic disease states, or those requiring rehabilitative care (Lipstein et al., 2016; AACN, 2019). Entry-level professional nursing education ensures that graduates demonstrate competencies through practice experiences with individuals, families, communities, and populations across the lifespan and within each of these four spheres of care. The workforce of the future needs to attract and retain registered nurses who choose to practice in diverse settings, including community settings to sustain the nation’s health.

It is time for nursing education to refocus and move beyond some long-held beliefs such as: primary care content is not important because it is not on the national licensing exam for registered nurses; students only value those skills required in acute care settings; and faculty preceptors only have limited community-based experiences. Recommendations from the Josiah Macy Foundation Conference (2016) on expanding the use of registered nursing in primary care provides a call to education and practice to place more value on primary care as a career choice, effectively changing the culture of nursing and health care. A collaborative effort between academic and practice leaders is needed to ensure this culture change and educate primary care practitioners about the value of the registered nurse role. \n\nSystems-Based Practice \n\nIntegrated healthcare systems that require coordination across settings as well as across the lifespan of diverse individuals and populations are emerging. Healthcare systems are revising strategic goals and reorganizing services to move more care from the most expensive venues – inpatient facilities and emergency departments – to primary care and community settings. Consequently, nurse employment settings also are shifting, creating a change in workforce distribution and the requisite knowledge and skills necessary to provide care in those settings. Knowledge differentiating equity and equality in healthcare systems and systems-based practice is essential. Nurses in the future are needed to lead initiatives to address structural racism, systemic inequity, and discrimination. Equitable healthcare better serves the needs of all individuals, populations, and communities. Importantly, an understanding of how local, national, and global structures, systems, politics, and rules and regulations contribute to the health outcomes of individual patients, populations, and communities will support students in developing agility and advocacy skills. Factors such as structural racism, cost containment, resource allocation, and interdisciplinary collaboration are considered and implemented to ensure the delivery of high quality, equitable, and safe patient care (Plack et al., 2018). \n\nInformatics and Technology \n\nInformatics increasingly has been a focus in nursing education, correlating with the advancement in sophistication and reach of information technologies, the use of technology to support healthcare processes and clinical thinking, and the ability of informatics and technology to positively impact patient outcomes. Health information technology is required for person-centered service across the continuum and requires consistency in user input, proper process, and quality management. While different specialty roles in nursing may require varying depth and breadth of informatics competency, basic informatics competencies are foundational to all nursing practice. Much work will be required to achieve full integration of core information and communication technologies competencies into nursing curricula. \n\nEngagement and Experience \n\nThe future consumers of health care are changing. They are transitioning from passive participants in medically focused acute care environments to engaged participants of healthcare services. They actively participate in managing not only their chronic illnesses but also acute © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Thus, nurses need an understanding of consumer engagement and experience across all settings as an essential component of person-centered, quality care. In today’s society, many people seek information and use technology to help make informed decisions about their health. Nurses seek to help patients determine what information to use and how to use it. Individuals want to know about their options when it comes to healthcare services, which extends to using websites to provide information on provider quality and performance, comparing prices for common procedures, and reviewing the effectiveness of treatments and care approaches (Adler-Milstein & Sinaiko, 2019). Gaffney (2015) stated that as consumers shoulder more of the financial responsibility for their health care, they became more educated about available options. Studies have shown that patients who are engaged in decision-making regarding their care have better outcomes and lower costs (Gaffney, 2015). Meaningful practice experiences in health care start with the individual who is actively engaged in the journey throughout the continuum of care. Each interaction between the recipient of care and the nurse or healthcare provider creates an experience. Practice experience is defined as “the sum of all interactions, shaped by an organization’s culture that influence patient perceptions across the continuum of care.” (Wolf, Niederhauser, Marshburn, & LaVela, 2014, p. 8). Within that interactive experience, the attitudes and the behaviors of the nurse matter a great deal. Nurses are identified as one of the most trusted professionals in the United States. Mutual trust is foundational to an interactive and ongoing relationship that will enhance a positive experience of care. Those with positive experiences of care often have better outcomes. Individual engagement has been described as “the blockbuster drug of the 21st century” (Dentzer, 2013). Who better to engage individuals in their care than nurses? Nursing practice has focused consistently on individual care and ongoing communication with family members and care providers. Sherman points to the fact that effective individual/family involvement leads to safer and higher quality care. In addition, individual/patient engagement can be directly correlated with increased reimbursement to hospitals based on achieving health outcomes. Nurses in all settings and across the continuum of care contribute to creating a culture that supports full engagement of individuals in their care and in the development of policies, which will provide guidance to the improvement of individual engagement (Sherman, 2014). \n\nAcademic-Practice Partnerships \n\nPartnerships and collaborative team-based care are the cornerstones of safe, effective care whether it be for individuals, families, communities, or populations. Academic-practice partnerships serve to recruit and retain nurses and to support the practice and academic enterprise in relation to mutual research, leadership development, and a shared commitment to redesign practice environments. Such partnerships also have the potential to facilitate the ability of nurses to achieve educational and career advancement, prepare nurses of the future to practice and lead, provide mechanisms for career-long learning, and provide a structure for transition to practice programs. Successful academic-practice partnerships are predicated on respect, relationship, reciprocity, and co-design. The 2016 report Advancing Healthcare Transformation: A New Era for Academic Nursing \n\nidentified a path for achieving enhanced partnerships between nursing schools and academic © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

While focused primarily on academic health centers, the recommendations apply to partnerships between non-academic health centers and schools of nursing as well. The recommendations include enhancing the clinical practice of academic nursing; partnering in the preparation of the nurses of the future; collaborating to develop workforce plans in partnership with the health system; integrating academic nursing into population health initiatives; partnering in the implementation of Accountable Care; and partnering for optimal patient care and healthcare delivery (AACN, 2016). \n\nCareer-Long Learning \n\nCurrent trends in higher education focus on supplemental methods of awarding credit and recognition for additional learning which has implications for career-long learning. Emerging educational methods should be considered as possible additions in the development of curriculum pathways in contemporary nursing education. For example, the use of e-portfolios, which may be used to record competency achievement and educational milestones and continued throughout one’s career, can be used to document personal development plans, badges, certifications, employment appraisals, and reflections on clinical events to establish meaning from various encounters. Awarding of micro-credentials or badges by academic institutions also is becoming popular. Badges recognize incremental learning in visible ways and can support career development (Educause, 2018). Stackable credentials can be accumulated over time and facilitate one’s professional development along a career trajectory (Department of Labor, 2015). Open access courses represent another way to learn a variety of skills or subject matter. All of these are important considerations in basic and advanced nursing education. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

These Essentials \n\ninclude 10 domains that were adapted from the interprofessional work initiated by Englander (2013) and tailored to reflect the discipline of nursing. This document delineates the domains that are essential to nursing practice, including how these are defined, what competencies should be expected for each domain at each level of nursing, and how those domains and competencies both distinguish nursing and relate to other health professions. Each domain has a descriptor (or working definition) and a contextual statement. The contextual statement (presented in the Domain, Competency, Sub-Competency Table found beginning on page 26) provides a framing for what the domain represents in the context of nursing practice – thus providing an explanation for how the competencies within the domain should be interpreted. The domain designations, descriptors, and contextual statements may evolve over time to reflect future changes in healthcare and nursing practice. Although the domains are presented as discrete entities, the expert practice of nursing requires integration of most of the domains in every practice situation or patient encounter, thus they provide a robust framework for competency-based education. The domains and descriptors used in the \n\nEssentials are listed below. \n\n• Domain 1: Knowledge for Nursing Practice \n\nDescriptor: Integration, translation, and application of established and evolving disciplinary nursing knowledge and ways of knowing, as well as knowledge from other disciplines, including a foundation in liberal arts and natural and social sciences. This distinguishes the practice of professional nursing and forms the basis for clinical judgment and innovation in nursing practice. \n\n• Domain 2: Person-Centered Care \n\nDescriptor: Person-centered care focuses on the individual within multiple complicated contexts, including family and/or important others. Person-centered care is holistic, individualized, just, respectful, compassionate, coordinated, evidence-based, and developmentally appropriate. Person-centered care builds on a scientific body of knowledge that guides nursing practice regardless of specialty or functional area. \n\n• Domain 3: Population Health \n\nDescriptor: Population health spans the healthcare delivery continuum from public health prevention to disease management of populations and describes collaborative activities with both traditional and non-traditional partnerships from affected communities, public health, industry, academia, health care, local government entities, and others for the improvement of equitable population health outcomes. \n\n• Domain 4: Scholarship for Nursing Discipline \n\nDescriptor: The generation, synthesis, translation, application, and dissemination of nursing knowledge to improve health and transform health care. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 11 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n• Domain 5: Quality and Safety \n\nDescriptor: Employment of established and emerging principles of safety and improvement science. Quality and safety, as core values of nursing practice, enhance quality and minimize risk of harm to patients and providers through both system effectiveness and individual performance. \n\n• Domain 6: Interprofessional Partnerships \n\nDescriptor: Intentional collaboration across professions and with care team members, patients, families, communities, and other stakeholders to optimize care, enhance the healthcare experience, and strengthen outcomes. \n\n• Domain 7: Systems-Based Practice \n\nDescriptor: Responding to and leading within complex systems of health care. Nurses effectively and proactively coordinate resources to provide safe, quality, equitable care to diverse populations. \n\n• Domain 8: Informatics and Healthcare Technologies \n\nDescriptor: Information and communication technologies and informatics processes are used to provide care, gather data, form information to drive decision making, and support professionals as they expand knowledge and wisdom for practice. Informatics processes and technologies are used to manage and improve the delivery of safe, high-quality, and efficient healthcare services in accordance with best practice and professional and regulatory standards. \n\n• Domain 9: Professionalism \n\nDescriptor: Formation and cultivation of a sustainable professional nursing identity, accountability, perspective, collaborative disposition, and comportment that reflects nursing’s characteristics and values. \n\n• Domain 10: Personal, Professional, and Leadership Development \n\nDescriptor: Participation in activities and self-reflection that foster personal health, resilience, and well-being, lifelong learning, and support the acquisition of nursing expertise and assertion of leadership. \n\n## Concepts for Nursing Practice \n\nIn addition to domains, there are featured concepts associated with professional nursing practice that are integrated within the Essentials . A concept is an organizing idea or a mental abstraction that represents important areas of knowledge. A common understanding of each concept is achieved through characteristics and attributes. Many disciplines, like nursing, have numerous concepts. The featured concepts are well-represented in the nursing literature and thus also are found throughout the Essentials and verified through a crosswalk analysis. Specifically, the featured concepts are found in the introduction, across the domains (within domain descriptors and contextual statements), and within the competencies and sub-competencies. Although not every concept is found within every domain, each concept is represented in most domains – and all domains have multiple concepts represented. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 12 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nThe featured concepts found within the Essentials are not of ‘lesser importance’ than a domain. Each of these concepts serves as a core component of knowledge, facts, and skills across multiple situations and contexts within nursing practice. Each concept functions as a hub for transferable knowledge, thus enhancing learning when learners make cognitive links to other information through mental constructs. The integration of concepts within the competencies and sub-competencies is essential for the application throughout the educational experience. As an example, can you imagine delivering person-centered care without also considering diversity, equity, and inclusion? Can you imagine having a conversation about population health without considering ethics and health policy? These concepts truly are interrelated and interwoven within the domains and competencies, serving as a foundation to students’ learning. The featured concepts are: \n\n• Clinical Judgment \n\nAs one of the key attributes of professional nursing, clinical judgment refers to the process by which nurses make decisions based on nursing knowledge (evidence, theories, ways/patterns of knowing), other disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking, and clinical reasoning (Manetti, 2019). This process is used to understand and interpret information in the delivery of care. Clinical decision making based on clinical judgment is directly related to care outcomes. \n\n• Communication \n\nCommunication, informed by nursing and other theories, is a central component in all areas of nursing practice. Communication is defined as an exchange of information, thoughts, and feelings through a variety of mechanisms. The definition encompasses the various ways people interact with each other, including verbal, written, behavioral, body language, touch, and emotion. Communication also includes intentionality, mutuality, partnerships, trust, and presence. Effective communication between nurses and individuals and between nurses and other health professionals is necessary for the delivery of high quality, individualized nursing care. With increasing frequency, communication is delivered through technological modalities. Communication also is a core component of team-based, interprofessional care and closely interrelated with the concept Social Determinants of Health (described below). \n\n• Compassionate Care \n\nAs an essential principle of person-centered care, compassionate care refers to the way nurses relate to others as human beings and involves “noticing another person’s vulnerability, experiencing an emotional reaction to this, and acting in some way with them in a way that is meaningful for people” (Murray & Tuqiri, 2020). Compassionate care is interrelated with other concepts such as caring, empathy, and respect and is also closely associated with patient satisfaction. \n\n• Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \n\nCollectively, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) refers to a broad range of individual, population, and social constructs and is adapted in the Essentials as one of the most visible concepts. Although these are collectively considered a concept, differentiation of each conceptual element leads to enhanced understanding. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 13 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nDiversity references a broad range of individual, population, and social characteristics, including but not limited to age; sex; race; ethnicity; sexual orientation; gender identity; family structures; geographic locations; national origin; immigrants and refugees; language; any impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; religious beliefs; and socioeconomic status. Inclusion represents environmental and organizational cultures in which faculty, students, staff, and administrators with diverse characteristics thrive. Inclusive environments require intentionality and embrace differences, not merely tolerate them (AACN, 2017; Bloomberg, 2019). Everyone works to ensure the perspectives and experiences of others are invited, welcomed, acknowledged, and respected in inclusive environments. Equity is the ability to recognize the differences in the resources or knowledge needed to allow individuals to fully participate in society, including access to higher education, with the goal of overcoming obstacles to ensure fairness (Kranich, 2001). To have equitable systems, all people should be treated fairly, unhampered by artificial barriers, stereotypes, or prejudices (Cooper, 2016). Two related concepts that fit within DEI include structural racism and social justice. (See the glossary for definitions of structural racism and social justice.) \n\n• Ethics \n\nCore to professional nursing practice, ethics refers to principles that guide a person’s behavior. Ethics is closely tied to moral philosophy involving the study of or examination of morality through a variety of different approaches (Tubbs, 2009). There are commonly accepted principles in bioethics that include autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice (ANA 2015; ACNM, 2015; AANA, 2018; ICN, 2012). The study of ethics as it relates to nursing practice has led to the exploration of other relevant concepts, including moral distress, moral hazard, moral community, and moral or critical resilience. \n\n• Evidence-Based Practice \n\nThe delivery of optimal health care requires the integration of current evidence and clinical expertise with individual and family preferences. Evidence-based practice is a problem-solving approach to the delivery of health care that integrates best evidence from studies and patient care data with clinician expertise and patient preferences and values (Melnyk, Fineout-Overhold, Stillwell, & Williamson, 2010). In addition there is a need to consider those scientific studies that ask: whose perspectives are solicited, who creates the evidence, how is that evidence created, what questions remain unanswered, and what harm may be created? Answers to these questions are paramount to incorporating meaningful, culturally safe, evidence-based practice (Nursing Mutual Aid, 2020). \n\n• Health Policy \n\nHealth policy involves goal directed decision-making about health that is the result of an authorized public decision-making process (Keller & Ridenour, 2021). Nurses play critical roles in advocating for policy that impacts patients and the profession, especially when speaking with a united voice on issues that affect nursing practice and health outcomes. Nurses can have a profound influence on health policy by becoming engaged in the policy process on many levels, which includes interpreting, evaluating, and leading policy change. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 14 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n• Social Determinants of Health \n\nDeterminants of health, a broader term, include personal, social, economic, and environmental factors that impact health. Social determinants of health, a primary component of determinants of health “are the conditions in the environment where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks.” The social determinants of health contribute to wide health disparities and inequities in areas such as economic stability, education quality and access, healthcare quality and access, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context (Healthy People, 2030). Nursing practices such as assessment, health promotion, access to care, and patient teaching support improvements in health outcomes. The social determinants of health are closely interrelated with the concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion, health policy, and communication. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 15 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n# Competencies and Sub-Competencies \n\nThe competencies identified in this Essentials document provide a bridge between the current and future needs of practice and the requisite education to prepare a competent practitioner. Competence develops over time, is progressive, and reflects the impact of internal and external factors and experiences of the student. Internal factors include education, experience, knowledge, and professional orientation, among others. External forces include the complexity of the learning experience and professional autonomy. While knowledge is essential to the development of competence, it does not in and of itself validate competence (Currier, 2019). Rather, learners progress to successive levels of competence by demonstrating achievement of expectations across the span of their education and practice experience. Students are successful when they meet and sustain measurable competence at each level of performance expectation and are able to transfer their competence across different practice experiences and settings (Josiah Macy Foundation, 2017). All competencies, organized within the 10 domains, are broad in scope and cross all levels and areas of nursing practice. The competency is intentionally written as a short statement; therefore, it is necessary to be familiar with the contextual statement within the parent domain to fully understand the competency. In other words, the competency is interpreted as a component within the domain. It also should be noted that there is intentional overlap of competencies in several domains to account for differences in the competency or sub-competency context in different domains. Each competency statement has multiple sub-competencies written at two levels to reflect learner expectations for entry-level and advanced nursing education. These sub-competencies are designed to ‘paint a picture’ of how the competency is achieved at each level. The sub-competencies are designed to be understandable, observable, and measurable by learner, faculty, and future employers. Competencies mature over time and become more sophisticated with ongoing practice. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 16 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n# A New Model for Nursing Education \n\nThese Essentials represents a new direction for nursing education, influenced by AACN’s Vision for Academic Nursing (AACN, 2019), setting in place a new model for preparing professional nurses, which includes a transition to competency-based education. This model provides the structure across education programs and provides a mechanism to adapt to future changes within nursing education. Currently, multiple educational programs and degree pathways exist that prepare nurses for similar roles. As an example, there are several types of programs and degrees that prepare students to become a registered nurse, and there are multiple education programs and paths to prepare a nurse practitioner (NP) and multiple types of NP certification. These multiple program options confuse external stakeholders as well as those within our own discipline regarding differences between an academic degree and a role – as if the academic degree signifies a specific nursing role. The new model is an intentional departure from the previous versions of the Essentials that were aligned to an academic degree. Thus, a primary intent of the \n\nEssentials is to create more consistency in graduate outcomes, influenced by the robustness of the learning experiences and demonstration of competencies. By emphasizing the attainment of competencies within an academic program, employers will have a clear expectation of knowledge and skill sets of nursing graduates. Two levels of sub-competencies reflect the educational stages of nurses as they enter professional practice and as they return to school to advance their education (see Figure 1). The first level sub-competencies set the foundation for nurses entering professional practice. These level one (entry-level) competencies are used within curricula for prelicensure preparation as well as professional nursing degree completion pathways for nurses with initial preparation at the associate degree or diploma level. Although learning experiences may vary across individual programs, they provide an opportunity for learners to demonstrate attainment of competencies in multiple and authentic contexts over time (not a “one and done”/checklist approach). The second level sub-competencies build and expand the competence of the nurse seeking advanced education in nursing and broadens the breadth of experiences in context and complexity as compared to graduates of entry-level programs. Advanced nursing education affords the student the opportunity to focus on an advanced nursing practice specialty or advanced nursing practice role. Level 2 sub-competencies form the foundation for all advanced education, and as conceptualized, apply to all advanced nursing practice specialties and advanced nursing practice roles. Referencing Thorne’s use of “nursing’s angle of vision” reinforces the importance of nurses using the unique knowledge and insight of the profession to inform any practice role and to impact the challenges in health care. Competencies designated for an advanced nursing practice specialty (informatics, administration/practice leadership, public health/population health, health policy) or an advanced practice nursing role (certified nurse practitioner, certified nurse-midwife, certified clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist) are integrated with and complement the Essentials competencies. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Competencies are used within the academic program as core expectations, thus setting a common standard. Additional elements within a degree plan will allow schools to differentiate degree paths using the same sub-competencies and to distinguish themselves in alignment with various institutional missions. This model adapts to the current state of nursing education, and perhaps more importantly, provides a path for an evolving trajectory for nursing education. Over time, higher education, stakeholder demands, nursing regulatory standards, and economics are among the many forces that will drive the direction and pace of change for nursing education in the future. This model has been designed to adapt to such future changes, not only for the degrees offered, but also for recognized areas of emphasis at the advanced education level by coupling with specialty competencies and/or certification standards. The Essentials do not apply directly to the preparation of nurse researchers in a PhD (or other nursing research-focused) program. However, the second-level sub-competencies could be used by PhD programs to guide core courses for doctoral nursing, particularly for programs offering baccalaureate to PhD degrees. Additionally, for nursing programs offering both DNP and PhD degrees and/or PhD to DNP or DNP to PhD options, the second-level core sub-competencies could form the basis for shared core courses between the two doctoral degree programs – representing efficiencies in program delivery as well as for more seamless pathways from one degree to the other. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 18 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n# Implementing the Essentials : Considerations for Curriculum \n\nThe domains, competencies, and concepts presented in the Essentials provide the platform for curriculum design and program assessment with an intent to produce consistency in outcomes expected of graduates. Although these are major elements incorporated within a curriculum for learning and assessment, they are not to be interpreted as representing the curriculum in its entirety. In other words, it is not intended for courses within nursing curricula to mirror the 10 domains and eight concepts. Instead, the elements used as the Essentials framework (domains, concepts, and competencies) should be integrated throughout and across the curriculum. A scaffolded approach ensures students interface with competencies in multiple contexts and with increasing complexity. Nursing programs have a great deal of flexibility in the development and design of curricula, thus preserving the ability of nursing programs to be unique or innovative. Outcomes, when referred to as student learning outcomes, describe the desired outcomes of the graduate at the completion of the program. The student learning outcomes will reflect attainment of all competencies in addition to any relevant specialty/role competencies and other identified expectations. Course design within curricula reflect the expectations of student learning with clear linkage from course objectives/competencies from within and across courses to end of program student learning outcomes, written as course learning outcomes or course competencies. For this reason, course outcomes should link to the Essentials competencies and concepts. Intentional teaching strategies are designed and incorporated throughout the curriculum in multiple contexts and with increasing complexity to provide students multiple opportunities for learning and demonstrating competencies. For the foreseeable future, minimum requirements for practicum experiences are deemed important to provide consistent and quality preparation at both the entry- and advanced-levels for professional nursing practice. Competencies are assessed as the learner progresses throughout the program; therefore, a robust program assessment plan is needed to measure students’ achievement of competencies by the end of the program. Some programs may wish to create “progression indicators” at specified points within a program of study to track learners’ achievement of competencies. To demonstrate the integration of competencies across multiple domains with increasing complexity, performance assessments should be integrated in the curriculum throughout the program of study. As such, assessments are performance based and serve as both a learning experience and an evaluation tool. Performance assessment is a multidimensional process, integral to learning, that involves observation and judgment of each student’s performance on the basis of explicit criteria, with feedback to the student for improving learning and competency. In the previous section, the Essentials Model featuring two levels of professional nursing education (entry and advanced) was introduced. While the domains, competencies, and concepts are identical for both entry and advanced levels of education, sub-competencies are used to differentiate expectations for entry (Level 1) and advanced (Level 2) professional nursing education (see Figure 1). These two levels of sub-competencies reflect the educational stages of nurses—as they enter professional nursing practice and as they advance their education— regardless of the program of study they are completing to advance their education. The following sections detail the expectations for curricula at each of these two levels. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 19 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n## Entry-Level Professional Nursing Education \n\nPrograms preparing nurses to enter professional nursing practice (either through prelicensure preparation or through a degree completion pathway for nurses with initial preparation with an associate or diploma degree) use Level 1 sub-competencies within the curriculum. Entry-level professional nursing programs prepare graduates as a generalist for practice across the lifespan and with diverse populations and in four spheres of practice. \n\n## Entry-Level Professional Nursing Degree Options \n\nPre-licensure Programs \n\nEntry-Level Professional Nursing Education sub-competencies (Level 1) are applied across any curriculum preparing for entry to professional nursing practice. Content learned within prerequisite courses is incorporated into the learning and assessment of the sub-competencies as applicable, and attainment of sub-competencies are applied within prerequisite courses. This does not mean that every sub-competency and concept is applied in every course, but it does mean that sub-competencies are not addressed in one course and then disregarded for the remainder of the program. Outcome measures include evidence of attainment of Level 1 sub-competencies, pass rates on the NCLEX-RN® (for traditional and accelerated tracks), and other institutional requirements. \n\nPost-Licensure Degree Programs \n\nLevel 1 core sub-competencies also are used in post-licensure or degree completion, first professional programs. Because learners in these programs are already licensed registered nurses, the Level 1 sub-competencies build on knowledge and skills acquired in their initial nursing education program. Verification of prior competency achievement in some domains may result in a shorter timeframe needed to prepare learners in these programs. \n\nAll learners in entry-level professional nursing education programs (pre-licensure and post-licensure [degree-completion] programs) will engage in direct patient care learning activities in all four spheres of care and across the lifespan. \n\nSpheres of Care and Entry-Level Professional Nursing Education \n\nAll entry-level professional nurses need knowledge and proficiencies to practice across a variety of settings. Accordingly, curricula for entry-level professional nursing education prepare the learner for generalist practice across the lifespan and with diverse populations, focusing on four spheres of care: promotion of health and well-being/disease prevention; chronic disease care; regenerative or restorative care; and hospice/palliative/supportive care (AACN, 2019; Lipstein et al., 2016; Figure 2). Didactic, simulated, laboratory, and clinical learning experiences prepare nurses to practice in these diverse settings. Level 1 sub-competencies apply across the spheres of care, requiring learners to \n\n> Wellness, Disease Prevention Regenerative /\n> Restorative Care\n> Chronic Disease Care\n> Hospice /\n> Palliative Care 4 Spheres of\n> Care\n\nFigure 2: Four Spheres of Care © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 20 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\ndemonstrate competencies in multiple contexts and settings. Demonstration of the Level 1 sub-competencies by the end of the program will enable the new professional nurse to practice as a generalist in any setting with diverse populations and with all ages. Although all students will have learning experiences across all four spheres of care, entry-level professional programs could create opportunities for students to gain additional education (through immersion experiences, electives, badges, or certificates) in any of the four spheres. Such a path would allow a graduate to have a defined area of emphasis (if desired) upon graduation, and/or to attain a documented area of emphasis in a post-entry level program certificate option. \n\nClinical Expectations \n\nEntry-level professional nursing education programs provide rich and varied opportunities for practice experiences (both direct and indirect care experiences) across the four spheres of care, designed to assist the graduate to achieve Level 1 sub-competencies upon completion of the program. Theoretical learning becomes a reality as students are coached to make cognitive connections between the cases or situations presented in the classroom, simulation, or laboratory and in actual practice settings. Clinical experiences also assist the graduate to develop proficiency in cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning. Clinical experiences are essential for students to care for a variety of individuals, families, groups, and populations across the lifespan and across the four spheres of care. Clinical learning provides opportunities for a student to enhance the provision of care and gain the skills needed to be an effective member of an interprofessional team; thus, interprofessional experiences in a variety of practice settings are essential. Graduates of all types of entry-level professional nursing education programs need sufficient practice experiences (both direct and indirect care experiences) to demonstrate end-of-program learning outcomes inclusive of all Level 1 sub-competencies. All learners in entry-level professional nursing education programs (pre-licensure and post-licensure [degree-completion] programs) will engage in direct patient care learning activities in all four spheres of care and across the life span and provide clear evidence of student (Level 1) competency achievement. \n\nClinical Sites \n\nNursing programs are responsible for ensuring clinical placements are safe, supportive, and conducive for learning by individual students or groups of students. The program is responsible for providing sufficient and appropriate clinical sites/placements for students to demonstrate attainment of Level 1 sub-competencies. The program faculty assesses clinical sites to determine that, on the aggregate, clinical experiences provide students learning opportunities to foster interprofessional team practice and to provide care within the four spheres of care and with care recipients from diverse backgrounds and cultures, from different genders and age groups and with different religious and spiritual practices, including those who may be considered most vulnerable. Programs are responsible for informing clinical educators or preceptors about the specific learning that is expected and occurring in didactic and laboratory settings and provide appropriate learning opportunities across settings to reinforce learning as well as demonstrate achievement of competencies (Level 1 sub-competencies) across the 10 \n\nEssentials domains. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 21 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nSimulation \n\nSimulation experiences represent an important component of clinical education, serving as a valuable augmentation to direct and indirect care within healthcare settings. Laboratory and simulation experiences provide an effective, safe environment for learning and demonstrating competencies. However, care experiences with actual individuals or groups continue to be the most important component of clinical education. A landmark study conducted by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing concluded that for pre-licensure students “substituting high-quality simulation experiences for up to half of traditional clinical hours produces comparable end-of-program educational outcomes” (Hayden et al., 2014, p. S3). Simulation cannot substitute for all direct care practice experiences in any one sphere or for any one age group. Also, simulation learning experiences should align with best practice standards such as those developed by the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning (INACSL) or the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH). The use of simulation in the curriculum as a replacement of direct patient clinical/practice hours or experiences is also determined by requirements of regulatory entities (i.e., licensing and accrediting bodies). \n\nPractice Synthesis Experience/Immersion \n\nDevelopment of competency attainment is facilitated through use of focused and sustained practice experiences. Immersion experiences provide the learner with the opportunity to integrate the Level 1 sub-competencies. Entry-level professional nursing programs (pre-and post-licensure) must develop immersion or synthesis experiences that allow students to integrate learning and gain experience that facilitates transition into practice. Such experiences provide opportunities to enact principles of the nursing discipline and for building clinical reasoning, management of care, and assessment of clinical outcomes. These opportunities increase the student’s self-confidence, professional identity, and sense of belonging within the profession. Immersion experiences also allow students to integrate previous learning and demonstrate competencies in more complex situations and contexts. Immersion experiences may afford the student an opportunity to focus on a population of interest and clinical role. The immersion experience may occur towards the end of the program as a culminating synthesis experience; and/or there may be one or more immersion experiences at various points in a curriculum. The key is to provide for a concentrated practice experience that approximates professional practice expectations (Fowler et al., 2018; Tratnack et al., 2011). \n\n## Advanced-Level Nursing Education \n\nNursing programs preparing nurses to advance their education beyond entry-level professional nursing practice will incorporate advanced-level nursing education (Level 2) sub-competencies. Advanced-level nursing education programs (degree granting and advanced nursing practice post-graduate certificate programs) intentionally build on Level 1 sub-competencies. Although Level 2 sub-competencies have been written with doctoral education in mind, the actual differentiator for the degree attained does not lie within the sub-competencies themselves, but rather the degree/program requirements – such as the DNP project (described below), role/ specialty requirements, and other requirements set by the faculty and institution. While it is not expected that every sub-competency and concept will be applied in every course, sub-competencies are not to be isolated in one or two courses and then disregarded for the rest of the program. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 22 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nAdvanced-level nursing education programs prepare graduates for practice in an advanced nursing practice specialty (informatics, administration/practice leadership, public health/ population health, health policy) or an advanced practice nursing role (certified nurse practitioner, certified nurse-midwife, certified clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist). Advanced-level nursing education programs focus on providing specialty knowledge for graduates to enact specific advanced practice nursing roles or assume advanced nursing specialty practice within the healthcare system. For this reason, specialty competencies, defined by nationally recognized, specialty organizations, represent a major component of advanced-level nursing education programs. Specialty competencies complement and build upon the Level 2 sub-competencies. All graduates of an advanced nursing education program are prepared and eligible for national, advanced nursing practice specialty certification or advanced nursing practice role certification when available. It is noteworthy that specialties evolve over time and new specialties may emerge. All DNP programs (post-baccalaureate and post-master’s) demonstrate that graduates attain and integrate Level 2 sub-competencies and competencies for at least one advanced nursing practice specialty or advanced nursing practice role. Individuals should seek to advance disciplinary expertise in a chosen nursing specialty or advanced nursing practice role. This expertise is critical to advancing the profession, to expand the influence of the profession for the transformation of health care, and to ensure an informed disciplinary perspective for teaching in the discipline. Advancing education in nursing with the emphasis on teaching and learning alone does not fulfill the achievement of disciplinary expertise. Excellence as an educator is achieved by the collective enterprise for faculty teaching and learning afforded by institutions and applied to discipline-specific teaching. \n\nAdvanced Level Practicum Experiences \n\nAdvanced-level nursing education programs provide rich and varied opportunities for practice experiences (both direct and indirect care experiences) to prepare graduates with the Level 2 sub-competencies as well as applicable advanced nursing practice specialty/advanced nursing practice role competencies and requirements. Practice experiences build on Level 1 sub-competency achievement and are designed to assist the graduate to achieve Level 2 sub-competencies and applicable specialty competencies upon completion of the program. Practice experiences are required to integrate didactic learning, promote innovative thinking, and test new potential solutions to clinical practice or system issues. Therefore, the development of new skills and practice expectations can be facilitated through use of creative learning opportunities in diverse settings. All graduates of advanced-level nursing education programs have structured, faculty-designed practice experiences, which may include precepted experiences with faculty oversight and/or experiences with direct faculty supervision. The program is responsible for providing sufficient and appropriate clinical sites/placements for students to demonstrate attainment of Level 2 sub-competencies and applicable specialty competencies. Clinical/practice learning experiences may be accomplished through diverse methodologies, including simulation and virtual technology, and assist the graduate to develop greater proficiency in these competencies, including cognitive, psychomotor, and affective competencies. Use of simulation should align with specialty requirements. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 23 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nAll advanced education practicum experiences must have faculty oversight and be verified and documented as a component of a formal course or plan of study. Programs provide practice placements that are safe, supportive, and conducive for learning. The nursing program faculty determine and assess practice sites to ensure that the site supports student learning with the intended population or scope of practice. Faculty, students, and preceptors must be well informed about the specific competencies that are integrated in the didactic, laboratory, and practice experiences and the method(s) to assess the achievement of the competencies. \n\nCompetency Attainment and Practice Experiences \n\nAll learners in advanced nursing education programs engage in practice learning activities (both direct and indirect care experiences). Graduates of all advanced nursing education programs need sufficient clinical/practice experiences to demonstrate end-of-program student outcomes, Level 2 sub-competencies, and competencies required by applicable national, specialty organizations and/or for national advanced nursing practice specialty or advanced nursing practice role certification. Programs document clear evidence of competency achievement. \n\nAdvanced Education Clinical/Practice Hours \n\nThe application of competency-based education to prepare advanced nursing professionals inherently calls to question the role of more traditional time-based requirements. In this \n\nEssentials model, there is an emphasis on ensuring that all nurses pursuing advanced education attain Level 2 sub-competencies as well as competencies required for an advanced nursing practice specialty or advanced nursing practice role being pursued. The number of required practice (direct and indirect care) hours vary based on advanced specialty/role requirements. These Essentials represent a commitment that required hours prepare a consistent product in terms of breadth of preparation and quality to reinforce confidence in our graduates by nursing practice colleagues, other health professionals, and consumers. Some learners will achieve select competency outcomes more quickly than others. “One and done,” however, does not demonstrate the progressive and consistent nature of competency attainment and the assessment necessary in nursing professional education. Repetition plays a role in reinforcing previously acquired knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. Repetition also allows for intentional and unintentional complexities and context nuances to be introduced, thus building on minimum competency thresholds. Given the paucity of evidence to support specific experience quantities, case numbers, or hourly requirements that should be achieved, a minimum threshold of hours of practice engagement remains necessary at this time. The specific clinical/practice experiences and number of practice hours and/or credit hours required depends on these Essentials , advanced nursing practice specialty and advanced nursing practice role requirements, and regulatory standards for specialty certifications and licensure. The program must include adequate experiences (in terms of time, diversity, depth, and breadth) to allow attainment and demonstration of all relevant competencies (Level 2 sub-competencies and applicable specialty/role competences and other requirements) and successful transition to practice demonstrated through program outcomes. The number of in-person practice hours will vary based on student needs and curriculum design. Participation in a minimum of 500 practice hours in the discipline of nursing, post entry-level education, and attainment of Level 1 sub-competencies is required for demonstration of the advanced © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 24 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nlevel sub-competencies. Some students may require more. These practice hours also provide a foundation for the additional time-based requirements set by specialty organizations or external licensing/certifying bodies, which will require additional practice time for preparation in advanced nursing specialties or advanced nursing practice roles. Hours of practice do not necessarily need to be delineated by competency type ( Essentials or specialty/role). Some, but not all, Level 2 sub-competencies and/or specialty/role competencies may be demonstrated and assessed concurrently. It is expected that faculty create clinical/practice learning experiences that provide for active learning, repetition, interprofessional engagement, and successive levels of difficulty. As the strength of evidence to support valid and reliable assessment techniques builds, the role of practice experiences and number of hours (e.g., time-based requirements) may evolve in the future. \n\nImmersion Practicum Experiences \n\nDevelopment of competency attainment is facilitated through use of focused and sustained practice experiences. Immersion experiences, expected in advanced nursing education programs, provide the learner with the opportunity to integrate the advanced level sub-competencies and applicable specialty competencies. An immersion also provides an opportunity for the learner to focus on a population of interest, an advanced nursing role, or specialty area of study. Placement of integrated or immersion experiences may vary and depend upon the program’s design, curriculum, and specialty requirements. \n\nSimulation \n\nSimulation experiences represent an important component of clinical/practice education, serving as a valuable augmentation to direct clinical care or practice within healthcare settings. Laboratory and simulation experiences provide an effective, safe environment for learning and demonstrating competencies, particularly high-risk and low-frequency experiences. However, practice experiences in actual practice settings continue to represent the most important component of nursing practice education and are required in advanced nursing programs for the learning and demonstration of the Level 2 sub-competencies and integration of specialty competencies. Simulation learning experiences align with best practice standards such as those developed by the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning (INACSL) or the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH). The use of simulation in the curriculum as a replacement of direct patient clinical/practice hours or experiences is also determined by requirements of national specialty education, certification entities, and regulatory entities. Practice experiences may include simulated experiences for the attainment of a portion of the Level 2 sub-competencies, particularly for experiences that are high risk and low frequency or may not be available to all students, and in accordance with requirements set forth by specialty organizations and/or licensing/certifying bodies. Regardless of the design of the experiences, programs are expected to document attainment of these sub-competencies through varied and comprehensive assessment methods across the curriculum. \n\nDNP Scholarly Project/Product \n\nThere are many past, present, and projected healthcare dilemmas that call for healthcare transformation. Nurses, as members of the healthcare team, are expected to assume a prominent role in addressing these dilemmas. Nurses cannot be expected to significantly © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 25 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nimpact healthcare transformation unless their educational preparation provides them with opportunities to learn and employ scholarship, leadership, and teamwork skills to advance practice. A scholarly work that aims to improve clinical practice, therefore, is required of students completing a practice doctorate in nursing. Collaboration with practice partners whenever possible will maximize the impact of the student experience. The scholarly work may take on various final forms depending on the academic institution’s requirements and the student’s area (specialty or role) of study/practice. Key elements of the scholarly work include problem identification; a search, analysis, and synthesis of the literature and evidence; translating evidence to construct a strategy or method to address a problem; designing a plan for implementation and actual implementation when possible, and an evaluation of the outcomes, process, and/or experience. Faculty may identify additional elements deemed necessary to meet the expected outcomes of the curriculum. Programs are encouraged to support innovation in the design and dissemination of the final project without reducing the substantive nature of the work. A literature review that lacks applicability to affect a practice improvement or the other elements identified above would not constitute a scholarly work that aligns with this Essentials model. Similarly, a portfolio may be used as a tool to enhance the development and presentation of a project but may not be the sole deliverable product of the student’s scholarly work. The scholarly work should not be a separate disaggregated part of the plan of study. Instead, faculty should consider how the development of the scholarly work is integrated throughout the curriculum, allowing for dissemination of the results prior to program completion. The intent is that this scholarly work reflects the longitudinal attainment of advanced level sub-competencies, going across the curriculum and allowing for the evolution of ideas. There also is a need to ensure an understanding by the student of the connection between the scholarly work and application to future practice. This will promote integration of advanced nursing education competencies into future practice. Dissemination methods for the scholarly work are determined by the student in consultation with the faculty and may include a variety of methods. Dissemination may include a final written product that is presented to a defined group of stakeholders, such as members of the practice and/or university community or participants at a local, state, or national professional meeting. Other possible examples of dissemination include poster presentations, a manuscript under review and/or submission for publication, an educational presentation, or a podcast. Faculty with appropriate specialty and academic credentials are involved in the planning, formation, and evaluation of the student’s scholarly work. In some instances, additional experts/mentors/ partners/facilitators can be formal or informal collaborators and provide intermittent or limited support throughout the project phases as needed. Evaluation of the student’s scholarly work may include a combination of methods, including faculty, expert, and/or peer evaluation. Programs tailor scholarly work evaluation and approval processes per institution’s, the program’s, and/or appropriate committee’s requirements. Evaluation of the final DNP project is the responsibility of the faculty. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

This distinguishes the practice of professional nursing and forms the basis for clinical judgment and innovation in nursing practice. \n\nContextual Statement: Knowledge for Nursing Practice provides the context for understanding nursing as a scientific discipline. The lens of nursing, informed by nursing history, knowledge, and science, reflects nursing’s desire to incorporate multiple perspectives into nursing practice, leading to nursing’s unique way of knowing and caring. Preparation in both liberal arts and sciences and professional nursing coursework provides graduates with the essential abilities to function as independent, intellectually curious, socially responsible, competent practitioners (Tobbell, 2018). A liberal education creates the foundation for the development of intellectual and practical abilities within the context of nursing. Further, liberal education is the key to understanding self and others; contributes to safe, quality care; and informs the development of clinical judgment. \n\nEntry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 1.1 Demonstrate an understanding of the discipline of nursing’s distinct perspective and where shared perspectives exist with other disciplines \n\n1.1a Identify concepts, derived from theories from nursing and other disciplines, which distinguish the practice of nursing. 1.1e Translate evidence from nursing science as well as other sciences into practice. 1.1b Apply knowledge of nursing science that develops a foundation for nursing practice. 1.1f Demonstrate the application of nursing science to practice. 1.1c Understand the historical foundation of nursing as the relationship developed between the individual and nurse. 1.1g Integrate an understanding of nursing history in advancing nursing’s influence in health care. 1.1d Articulate nursing’s distinct perspective to practice. \n\n1.2 Apply theory and research-based knowledge from nursing, the arts, humanities, and other sciences. \n\n1.2a Apply or employ knowledge from nursing science as well as the natural, physical, and social sciences to build an understanding of the human experience and nursing practice. 1.2f Synthesize knowledge from nursing and other disciplines to inform education, practice, and research. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Person-centered care is holistic, individualized, just, respectful, compassionate, coordinated, evidence-based, and developmentally appropriate. Person-centered care builds on a scientific body of knowledge that guides nursing practice regardless of specialty or functional area. \n\nContextual Statement: Person-centered care is the core purpose of nursing as a discipline. This purpose intertwines with any functional area of nursing practice, from the point of care where the hands of those that give and receive care meet, to the point of systems-level nursing leadership. Foundational to person-centered care is respect for diversity, differences, preferences, values, needs, resources, and the determinants of health unique to the individual. The person is a full partner and the source of control in team-based care. Person-centered care requires the intentional presence of the nurse seeking to know the totality of the individual’s lived experiences and connections to others (family, important others, community). As a scientific and practice discipline, nurses employ a relational lens that fosters mutuality, active participation, and individual empowerment. This focus is foundational to educational preparation from entry to advanced levels irrespective of practice areas. With an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion, person-centered care is based on best evidence and clinical judgment in the planning and delivery of care across time, spheres of care, and developmental levels. Contributing to or making diagnoses is one essential aspect of nursing practice and critical to an informed plan of care and improving outcomes of care (Olson et al., 2019). Diagnoses at the system-level are equally as relevant, affecting operations that impact care for individuals. Person-centered care results in shared meaning with the healthcare team, recipient of care, and the healthcare system, thus creating humanization of wellness and healing from birth to death. \n\n> Entry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 2.1 Engage with the individual in establishing a caring relationship.\n> 2.1a Demonstrate qualities of empathy. 2.1d Promote caring relationships to effect positive outcomes. 2.1b Demonstrate compassionate care. 2.1e Foster caring relationships. 2.1c Establish mutual respect with the individual and family.\n> 2.2 Communicate effectively with individuals.\n> 2.2a Demonstrate relationship-centered care. 2.2g Demonstrate advanced communication skills and techniques using a variety of modalities with diverse audiences. 2.2b Consider individual beliefs, values, and personalized information in communications. 2.2h Design evidence-based, person-centered engagement materials. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

(Kindig & Stoddart, 2003; Kindig, 2007; Swartout & Bishop, 2017; CDC, 2020). \n\nContextual Statement: A population is a discrete group that the nurse and others care for across settings at local, regional, national, and global levels. Population health spans the healthcare delivery continuum, including public health, acute care, ambulatory care, and long-term care. Population health also encompasses collaborative activities among stakeholders – all relevant individuals and organizations involved in care, including patients and communities themselves - for the improvement of a population’s health status. The purpose of these collaborative activities, including development of interventions and policies, is to strive towards health equity and improved health for all. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and ethics must be emphasized and valued. Accountability for outcomes is shared by all, since outcomes arise from multiple factors that influence the health of a defined group. Population health includes population management through systems thinking, including health promotion and illness prevention, to achieve population health goals (Storfjell, Wehtle, Winslow, & Saunders, 2017). Nurses play a critical role in advocating for, developing, and implementing policies that impact population health globally and locally. In addition, nurses respond to crises and provide care during emergencies, disasters, epidemics, or pandemics. They play an essential role in system preparedness and ethical response initiatives. Although each type of public health emergency will likely require a unique set of competencies, preparedness for responding begins with a population health perspective and a particular focus on surveillance, prevention, and containment of factors contributing to the emergency. \n\n> Entry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 3.1 Manage population health.\n> 3.1a Define a target population including its functional and problem-solving capabilities (anywhere in the continuum of care). 3.1j Assess the efficacy of a system’s capability to serve a target sub-population’s healthcare needs. 3.1b Assess population health data. 3.1k Analyze primary and secondary population health data for multiple populations against relevant benchmarks. 3.1c Assess the priorities of the community and/or the affected clinical population. 3.1l Use established or evolving methods to determine population-focused priorities for care. 3.1d Compare and contrast local, regional, national, and global benchmarks to identify health patterns across populations. 3.1m Develop a collaborative approach with relevant stakeholders to address population healthcare needs, including evaluation methods. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Scholarship is inclusive of discovery, application, integration, and teaching. While not all inclusive, the scholarship of discovery includes primary empirical research, analysis of large data sets, theory development, and methodological studies. The scholarship of practice interprets, draws together, applies, and brings new insight to original research (Boyer, 1990; AACN 2018). Knowledge of the basic principles of the research process, including the ability to critique research and determine its applicability to nursing’s body of knowledge, is critical. Ethical comportment in the conduct and dissemination of research and advocacy for human subjects are essential components of nursing’s role in the process of improving health and health care. Whereas the research process is the generation of new knowledge, evidence-based practice (EBP) is the process for the application, translation, and implementation of best evidence into clinical decision-making. While evidence may emerge from research, EBP extends beyond just data to include patient preferences and values as well as clinical expertise. Nurses, as innovators and leaders within the interprofessional team, use the uniqueness of nursing in nurse-patient relationships to provide optimal care and address health inequities, structural racism, and systemic inequity. \n\nEntry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 4.1 Advance the scholarship of nursing. \n\n4.1a Demonstrate an understanding of different approaches to scholarly practice. 4.1h Apply and critically evaluate advanced knowledge in a defined area of nursing practice. 4.1b Demonstrate application of different levels of evidence. 4.1i Engage in scholarship to advance health. 4.1c Apply theoretical framework(s)/models in practice. 4.1j Discern appropriate applications of quality improvement, research, and evaluation methodologies. 4.1d Demonstrate an understanding of basic elements of the research process. 4.1k Collaborate to advance one’s scholarship. 4.1e Participate in scholarly inquiry as a team member. 4.1l Disseminate one’s scholarship to diverse audiences using a variety of approaches or modalities. 4.1f Evaluate research. 4.1m Advocate within the interprofessional team and with other stakeholders for the contributions of nursing scholarship. 4.1g Communicate scholarly findings. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Quality and safety, as core values of nursing practice, enhance quality and minimize risk of harm to patients and providers through both system effectiveness and individual performance. \n\nContextual Statement: Provision of safe, quality care necessitates knowing and using established and emerging principles of safety science in care delivery. Quality and safety encompass provider and recipient safety and the recognition of synergy between the two. Quality or safety challenges are viewed primarily as the result of system failures, as opposed to the errors of an individual. In an environment fostering quality and safety, caregivers are empowered and encouraged to promote safety and take appropriate action to prevent and report adverse events and near misses. Fundamental to the provision of safe, quality care, providers of care adopt, integrate, and disseminate current practice guidelines and evidence-based interventions. Safety is inclusive of attending to work environment hazards, such as violence, burnout, ergonomics, and chemical and biological agents; there is a synergistic relationship between employee safety and patient safety. A safe and just environment minimizes risk to both recipients and providers of care. It requires a shared commitment to create and maintain a\n\nphysically, psychologically, secure, and just environment. Safety demands an obligation to remain non-punitive in detecting, reporting, and analyzing errors, possible exposures, and near misses when they occur. Quality and safety are interdependent, as safety is a necessary attribute of quality care. For quality health care to exist, care must be safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable, and person-centered. Quality care is the extent to which care services improve desired health outcomes and are consistent with patient preferences and current professional knowledge (IOM, 2001). Additionally, quality care includes collaborative engagement with the recipient of care in assuming responsibility for health promotion and illness treatment behaviors. Quality care both improves desired health outcomes, and prevents harm (IOM, 2001). Addressing contributors and barriers to quality and safety, at both individual and system levels, are necessary. Essentially, everyone in health care is responsible for quality care and patient safety.

Nurses effectively and proactively coordinate resources to provide safe, quality, and equitable care to diverse populations. \n\nContextual Statement: Using evidence-based methodologies, nurses lead innovative solutions to address complex health problems and ensure optimal care. Understanding of systems-based practice is foundational to the delivery of quality care and incorporates key concepts of organizational structure, including relationships among macro-, meso-, and microsystems across healthcare settings. Knowledge of financial and payment models relative to reimbursement and healthcare costs is essential. In addition, the impact of local, regional, national, and global structures, systems, and regulations on individuals and diverse populations must be considered when evaluating patient outcomes. As change agents and leaders, nurses possess the intellectual capacity to be agile in response to continually evolving healthcare systems, to address structural racism and other forms of discrimination, and to advocate for the needs of diverse populations. Systems-based practice is predicated on an ethical practice environment where professional and organizational values are aligned, and structures and processes enable ethical practice by all members of the institution. Integrated healthcare systems are highly complex, and gaps or failures in service and delivery can cause ineffective, harmful outcomes. These outcomes also span individual through global networks. Cognitive shifting from focused to big picture is a crucial skill set. Similarly, the ability for nurses to predict change, employ improvement strategies, and exercise fiscal prudence are critical skills. System awareness, innovation, and design also are needed to address such issues as structural racism and systemic inequity.  \n\n> Entry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 7.1 Apply knowledge of systems to work effectively across the continuum of care.\n> 7.1a Describe organizational structure, mission, vision, philosophy, and values. 7.1e Participate in organizational strategic planning. 7.1b Explain the relationships of macrosystems, mesosystems, and microsystems. 7.1f Participate in system-wide initiatives that improve care delivery and/or outcomes. 7.1c Differentiate between various healthcare delivery environments across the continuum of care. 7.1g Analyze system-wide processes to optimize outcomes. 7.1d Recognize internal and external system processes that impact care coordination and transition of care. 7.1h Design policies to impact health equity and structural racism within systems, communities, and populations.\n> 7.2 Incorporate consideration of cost-effectiveness of care.\n> 7.2a Describe the financial and payment models of health care. 7.2g Analyze relevant internal and external factors that drive healthcare costs and reimbursement. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Informatics processes and technologies are used to manage and improve the delivery of safe, high-quality, and efficient healthcare services in accordance with best practice and professional and regulatory standards. \n\nContextual Statement: Healthcare professionals interact with patients, families, communities, and populations in technology-rich environments. Nurses, as essential members of the healthcare team, use information and communication technologies and informatics tools in their direct and indirect care roles. The technologies, the locations in which they are used, the users interacting with the technology, the communication occurring, and the work being done all impact the data collected, information formed, decisions made, and the knowledge generated. Additionally, the utilization of information and communication technologies in healthcare settings changes how people, processes, and policies interact. Using these tools in the provision of care has both short- and long-term consequences for the quality of care, efficiency of communications, and connections between team members, patients, and consumers. It is essential that nurses at all levels understand their role and the value of their input in health information technology analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. With the prevalence of patient-focused health information technologies, all nurses have a responsibility to advocate for equitable access and assist patients and consumers to optimally use these tools to engage in care, improve health, and manage health conditions. \n\nEntry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 8.1 Describe the various information and communication technology tools used in the care of patients, communities, and populations. \n\n8.1a Identify the variety of information and communication technologies used in care settings. 8.1g Identify best evidence and practices for the application of information and communication technologies to support care. 8.1b Identify the basic concepts of electronic health, mobile health, and telehealth systems for enabling patient care. 8.1h Evaluate the unintended consequences of information and communication technologies on care processes, communications, and information flow across care settings. 8.1c Effectively use electronic communication tools. 8.1i Propose a plan to influence the selection and implementation of new information and communication technologies. 8.1d Describe the appropriate use of multimedia applications in health care. 8.1j Explore the fiscal impact of information and communication technologies on health care. 8.1e Demonstrate best practice use of social networking applications. 8.1k Identify the impact of information and communication technologies on workflow processes and healthcare outcomes. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Professional identity formation necessitates the development of emotional intelligence to promote social good, engage in social justice, and demonstrate ethical comportment, moral courage, and assertiveness in decision making and actions. Nursing professionalism is a continuous process of socialization that requires the nurse to give back to the profession through the mentorship and development of others. Professional identity, influenced by one’s personal identity and unique background, is formed throughout one’s education and career. Nursing identity flourishes through engagement and reflection in multiple experiences that is defined by differing perspectives and voices. As a result, nurses embrace the history, characteristics, and values of the discipline and think, act, and feel like a nurse. Professional identity formation is not a linear process but rather one that responds to challenges and matures through professional experiences as one develops confidence as a nurse. \n\nEntry-Level Professional Nursing Education Advanced-Level Nursing Education 9.1 Demonstrate an ethical comportment in one’s practice reflective of nursing’s mission to society. \n\n9.1a Apply principles of professional nursing ethics and human rights in patient care and professional situations. 9.1h Analyze current policies and practices in the context of an ethical framework. 9.1b Reflect on one’s actions and their consequences. 9.1i Model ethical behaviors in practice and leadership roles. 9.1c Demonstrate ethical behaviors in practice. 9.1j Suggest solutions when unethical behaviors are observed. 9.1d Change behavior based on self and situational awareness. 9.1k Assume accountability for working to resolve ethical dilemmas. 9.1e Report unethical behaviors when observed. 9.1f Safeguard privacy, confidentiality, and autonomy in all interactions. 9.1g Advocate for the individual’s right to self-determination. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

An APRN is a nurse who has 1.) completed an accredited graduate-level education program preparing him/her for one of the four recognized APRN roles; 2.) passed a national certification examination that measures APRN role and population-focused competencies and who maintains continued competence as evidenced by recertification in the role and population through the national certification program; 3.) acquired advanced clinical knowledge and skills preparing him/her to provide direct care to patients, as well as a component of indirect care; 4.) built on the competencies of registered nurses by demonstrating a greater depth and breadth of knowledge, a greater synthesis of data, increased complexity of skills and interventions, and greater role autonomy; 5.) been educationally prepared to assume responsibility and accountability for health promotion and/or maintenance as well as the assessment, diagnosis, and management of patient problems, which includes the use and prescription of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions; 6.) clinical experience of sufficient depth and breadth to reflect the intended license; and 7.) obtained a license to practice in one of the four APRN roles (APRN Consensus Work Group & NCSBN APRN Advisory Committee, 2008). \n\nAPRN Core: APRN education programs include at a minimum, three separate comprehensive graduate-level courses in: Advanced physiology and pathophysiology, which includes general principles that apply across the lifespan; Advanced health assessment, which includes assessment of all human systems, advanced assessment techniques, concepts and approaches; and Advanced pharmacology, which includes pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacotherapeutics of all broad categories of agents (APRN Consensus Work Group & NCSBN APRN Advisory Committee, 2008). \n\nAdvocacy: The act or process of supporting a cause or proposal: the act or process of advocating. Advocacy is a pillar of nursing. Nurses instinctively advocate for their patients, in their workplaces, and in their communities; but legislative and political advocacy is equally important to advancing patient care. \n\nAnalytic approach: Any method based on breaking down a complex process into its parts so as to better understand the whole. \n\nAuthentic or intentional presence: Being fully present in the moment This extends to possessing an awareness of when you drift and how to intentionally bring yourself back to the interaction (Altman, 2014). © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

Given these definitions, outcomes related to clinical practice are any change that resulted from health care. \n\nCaring relationship: Caring constitutes the essence of what it is to be human, having a profound effect on well -being and recovery, being at ease, and being healed. When hospitality is received, patients feel a connection, they begin to trust, and their healing begins. \n\nClinical immersion: A brief, structured, intense nursing practicum where the entire focus is in a particular clinical setting without the distraction of other academic classes (Tratnack, et al., 2011). \n\nClinical judgment: The skill of recognizing cues regarding a clinical situation, generating and weighing hypotheses, taking action, and evaluating outcomes for the purpose of arriving at a satisfactory clinical outcome. Clinical judgment is the observed outcome of two unobserved underlying mental processes, critical thinking and decision making (NCSBN, 2018). \n\nClinical reasoning: Thought processes that allow healthcare providers to arrive at a conclusion. \n\nCognitive flexibility: A critical executive function involving the ability to adapt behaviors in response to changes in the environment. Cognitive flexibility generally refers to the ability to adapt flexibly to a constantly changing environment. \n\nComplex systems: Systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Complex systems have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. \n\nCompetence: The array of abilities (knowledge, skills, and attitudes) across multiple domains or aspects of performance in a certain context. Competence is multi-dimensional and dynamic (Frank, Snell, Cate, et al., 2010). \n\nCompetency: An observable ability of a health professional, integrating multiple components such as knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. Since competencies are observable, they can be measured and assessed to ensure their acquisition (Frank, Snell, Cate, et al., 2010). \n\nCompetency framework: An organized and structured representation of a set of interrelated and purposeful competencies (Englander et al., 2013, p. 1089). \n\nCompetency list: The delineation of the specific competencies within a competency framework (Englander, et al., 2013, p.1089). \n\nConcepts: A concept is an organizing idea or mental construct represented by common attributes.

AACN has identified core disciplinary knowledge as having three components: historic and philosophic foundations to the development of nursing knowledge; existing and evolving substantive nursing knowledge; and methods and processes of theory/knowledge development (AACN, 2002, p. 289). \n\nCost effectiveness: A way to examine both the costs and health outcomes of one or more interventions; it compares one intervention to another (or the status quo) by estimating how much it costs to gain a unit of a health outcome, like a life year gained or a death prevented. \n\nCritical thinking: The skill of using logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative healthcare solutions, conclusions, or approaches to clinical or practice problems. \n\nCultural awareness: The deliberate self-examination and in-depth exploration of one’s biases, stereotypes, prejudices, assumptions, and “isms” that one holds regarding individuals and groups who are different from them (Campinha-Bacote, 1998). \n\nCultural competence: The ability to effectively work within the client’s cultural context. Structural competence is recognition of the economic and political conditions that produce health inequalities in the first place. It is the ability to understand how institutions, markets, or healthcare delivery systems shape symptom presentations and to mobilize for correction of health and wealth inequalities in society (Drevdahl, 2018; Metzl et al., 2018; Metzl et al., 2020). \n\nCultural and linguistic competence: A set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals that enables effective work in cross-cultural situations. ‘Culture’ refers to integrated patterns of human behavior that include the language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and institutions of racial, ethnic, religious, or social groups. ‘Competence’ implies having the capacity to function effectively as an individual and an organization within the context of the cultural beliefs, behaviors, and needs presented by consumers and their communities (Cross et al., 1989). Cultural competence is a developmental process that evolves over an extended period. \n\nCulturally sensitive: “The ability to be appropriately responsive to the attitudes, feelings, or circumstances of groups of people that share a common and distinctive racial, national, religious, linguistic, or cultural heritage” (DHHS, OMH, 2001, p. 131). \n\nCultural humility: A lifelong process of self-reflection and self-critique whereby the individual not only learns about another’s culture, but also examines her/his own beliefs and cultural identities .\n\nDeterminants of health: The range of personal, social, economic, and environmental factors that interrelate to determine individual and population health. These factors include policymaking, social factors, health services, individual behaviors, and biology and genetics.

To have equitable systems, all people should be treated fairly, unhampered by artificial barriers, stereotypes, or prejudices (Cooper, 2016). \n\nEthical comportment: The way in which nurses embody the ability to relate to others respectfully and responsively (Benner, 2009. Ethical comportment consists of four critical attributes: 1) embodiment, 2) skilled relational know-how, 3) caring, and 4) salience (Hardin, 2018). \n\nEthical competence: The ability to recognize an ethical situation/issue (awareness/sensitivity), the ability to determine a justifiable action (reflection/decision-making), and have the motivation, knowledge, and skills to implement a decision (comportment and action) (ANA Scope & Standards, 2021). \n\nEvidence-based practice: A conscientious, problem-solving approach to clinical practice that incorporates the best evidence from well-designed studies, patient values and preferences, and a clinician’s expertise in making decisions regarding a patient’s care. Being knowledgeable about evidence-based practice and levels of evidence is important for clinicians to be confident about how much emphasis they should place on a study, report, practice alert or practice guideline when making decisions about a patient’s care. \n\nExplicit biases: Conscious positive or negative feelings and/or thoughts about groups or identity characteristics. Because these attitudes are explicit in nature, they are espoused openly, through overt and deliberate thoughts and actions (Harrison et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2000) © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 59 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nFamily : An individual’s closest support structure that is inclusive of birth family, single parent families, blended families, families with stepparents, and families with homosexual parents to name a few. The concept of the contemporary family has evolved into a fluid ideology that is constantly shifting and changing throughout society. \n\nHealth disparities: “A particular type of health difference that is closely linked with economic, social, or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater social or economic obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group, religion, socioeconomic status, gender, age, or mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion” (US Department of Health and Human Services (2010). \n\nHealth equity: When every person has an opportunity to attain his or her full health potential” and no one is “disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social position or other socially determined circumstances (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Health inequities are reflected in differences in length of life; quality of life; rates of disease, disability, and death; severity of disease; and access to treatment. \n\nHealth inequity: The distribution and allocation of power and resources differentially, which manifest in unequal social, economic, and environmental conditions (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). \n\nHealth Information Technology (HIT): The electronic systems healthcare professionals and patients use to store, share, and analyze health information. HIT consists of many types of applications such as Electronic Health Records, personal health records, electronic prescribing, mobile applications, social networks, monitors, wearables, nanotechnology, genomics, and robotics (Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology [ONC], 2018). \n\nHealthcare team: The collective of individuals who contribute to the care and treatment of an individual, family, group, or population. \n\nHealthy lifestyle: A way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Scientific studies have identified certain types of behavior that contribute to the development of noncommunicable diseases and early death. Health is not only just about avoiding disease. It involves physical, mental and social wellbeing. \n\nHolistic admissions review: An admissions strategy that assesses an applicant’s unique experiences alongside traditional measures of academic achievement, such as grades and test scores. This process is used to help schools consider a broad range of factors reflecting the applicant’s academic readiness, contribution to the incoming class, and potential for success both in school and later as a professional. \n\nHolistic nursing: “All nursing practice that has healing the whole person as its goal” (American Holistic Nurses’ Association, 1998). © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 60 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nImplicit and unconscious biases: The tendency to process information based on unconscious associations and feelings, even when these are contrary to one’s conscious or declared beliefs. They are automatically activated and may occur unconsciously (Metzl et al., 2018, 2020; Van Ryn et al. 2011). \n\nInclusive environments: Environmental and organizational cultures in which faculty, students, staff, and administrators with diverse characteristics thrive. Inclusive environments require intentionality and embrace differences, not merely tolerate them. Everyone works to ensure the perspectives and experiences of others are invited, welcomed, acknowledged, and respected. \n\nInequities: Characterized by a lack of equity, injustice, unfairness. \n\nInformatics: The intersection between the work of stakeholders across the health and healthcare delivery system who seek to improve outcomes, lower costs, increase safety and promote the use of high-quality services. It is frequently confused with data science, big data, health information management and data analytics, informatics is the overarching field of study that pulls all these subdomains into one discipline focused on improving health and healthcare. Emerging topics like artificial intelligence and machine learning are incorporating in the field of informatics (AMIA, 2021). \n\nInformation and Communications Technologies (ICT): Technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications, including the internet, telephones, cell phones, wireless signals, networks, satellite systems, telehealth/telenursing, and video conferencing. \n\nInnovation: A great idea to develop and deliver new or improved health policies, systems, products and technologies, and services and delivery methods that improve people’s health (WHO Health Innovation Group, 2021). \n\nIntegration: An experience designed to provide the student with an opportunity to synthesize the knowledge and skills acquired during previous and current coursework and learning experiences. \n\nIntentional change theory: The essential components and processes of desirable, sustainable change in one’s behavior, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. The “change” maybe in a person’s actions, habits, competencies, or aspirations as well as in the way one feels in certain situations or around certain people. The change may impact how one looks at events at work or in life. The change is “desired” in that person wishes it so or would like to occur and is “sustainable” in that it endures and lasts a relatively long time (Boyatzis, 2006). \n\nInterdisciplinary: Refers to a group of healthcare providers with various areas of expertise who work together toward the goals of their clients. \n\nInteroperability: The ability of different information systems, devices, and applications (systems) to access, exchange, integrate, and cooperatively use data in a coordinated manner, within and across organizational, regional, and national boundaries to provide timely and seamless portability of information and optimize the health of individuals and populations globally. Health data exchange architectures, application interfaces, and standards enable data to be accessed and shared appropriately and securely across the complete spectrum of care, within all applicable settings and with relevant stakeholders, including the individual. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 61 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nInterprofessional: Engagement involving two or more professions or professionals. \n\nInterprofessional team: The cooperation, coordination, and collaboration expected among members of different professions in delivering patient-centered care collectively. \n\nJust culture: Balances the need for an open and honest reporting environment with a quality learning environment and culture. All individuals within this environment are held responsible for the quality of their choices. Just culture requires a change in focus from errors and outcomes to system design and management of the behavioral choices of all employees. \n\nLifelong learning: The provision or use of both formal and informal learning opportunities throughout one’s life to foster the continuous development and improvement of the knowledge and skills needed for employment and personal fulfillment. \n\nMacrosystem: The highest system level represents the whole of the organization and is led by senior leaders such as the CEO, chief operations officer (COO), chief nursing officer (CNO), and chief information officer (CIO) and is guided by a board of trustees (Nelson, et al., 2007). \n\nManaging disease: To improve the health of persons with chronic conditions and reduce associated costs from avoidable complications by identifying and treating chronic conditions more quickly and more effectively, thus slowing the progression of diseases. \n\nMesosystem: The interrelated units and clinical leadership that provide care to certain populations (McKinley et al., 2008). \n\nMicrosystem: Small, functional frontline units that provide the most health care to most people (Nelson et al., 2007, p.3). A clinical microsystem is a small group of people who work together on a regular basis to provide care to discrete subpopulations of patients. These units have clinical and business aims, linked processes, and a shared information environment, and focus on producing performance outcomes. Microsystems are complex adaptive systems, and as such they must do the primary work associated with core aims, meet the needs of internal staff, and maintain themselves over time as clinical units (Nelson, et al., 2002). \n\nMitigation: The action of reducing the severity, seriousness, or painfulness of something. \n\nMobile health (mHealth): The use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives. The expanding use of mobile health is driven rapid advances in mobile technologies and applications, a rise in new opportunities for the integration of mobile health into existing eHealth services, and the continued growth in coverage of mobile cellular networks. \n\nMoral courage: The willingness of individuals to take hold of, and fully support, ethical responsibilities essential to professional values (Day, 2007). This highly esteemed trait is displayed by individuals, who, despite adversity and personal risk, decide to act upon their ethical values to help others during difficult ethical dilemmas. Moral courage entails doing the right thing, even when others choose less ethical behavior, which may include taking no action at all (Lachman, 2009; 2007a; 2007b; Sekerka & Bagozzi, 2007). \n\nMoral ethical behaviors: Prevailing standards of behavior used to judge right and wrong. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 62 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nNurse sensitive indicators: Reflect three aspects of nursing care: structure, process, and outcomes. Structural indicators include the supply of nursing staff, the skill level of nursing staff, and the education and certification levels of nursing staff. Process indicators measure methods of patient assessment and nursing interventions. Nursing job satisfaction is also considered a process indicator. Outcome indicators reflect patient outcomes that depend on the quantity or quality of nursing care (e.g., pressure ulcers and falls). \n\nNursing informatics: The specialty that integrates nursing science with multiple information and analytical sciences to identify, define, manage, and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in nursing practice (HIMSS, 2021). \n\nParticipatory approach: Calls for involving stakeholders, particularly the participants in a program or those affected by a given policy, in specific aspects of the evaluation process. The approach covers a wide range of different types of participation, and stakeholders can be involved at any stage of the impact evaluation process, including its design, data collection, analysis, reporting, and managing a study. \n\nPartnerships: Close cooperation between parties having specified and joint rights and responsibilities. \n\nPatient: The recipient of a healthcare service or intervention at the individual, family, community, or aggregate level. Patients may function in independent, interdependent, or dependent roles, and may seek or receive nursing interventions related to disease prevention, health promotion, or health maintenance, as well as illness and end-of-life care (AACN, 2006). \n\nPerson-Centered Care: “Empowering people to take charge of their own health rather than being passive recipients of services” (WHO, 2021). This care strategy is based on the belief that patient views, input, and experiences can help improve overall health outcomes. \n\nPoint of Care: Where care is delivered, including in diverse settings where individuals live, learn, work, play, and worship. \n\nPopulation: A collection of individuals who have one or more personal or environmental characteristics in common. \n\nPractice: Any form of nursing intervention that influences healthcare outcomes for individuals or populations, including the direct care of individual patients, management of care for individuals and populations, administration of nursing and healthcare organizations, and the development and implementation of health policy (AACN, 2004). Practice includes both direct and indirect care experiences (defined below). \n\nDirect Care/Indirect Care: \n\n• Direct care refers to a professional encounter between a nurse and an actual individual or family, either face to face or virtual, that is intended to achieve specific health goals or achieve selected health outcomes. Direct care may be provided in a wide range of settings, including acute and critical care, long term care, home health, community-based settings, and telehealth. (AACN, 2004, 2006; Suby, 2009; Upenieks, Akhavan, Kotlerman et al., 2007). © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 63 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\n• Indirect care refers to nursing decisions, actions, or interventions that are provided through or on behalf of individuals, families, or groups. These decisions or interventions create the conditions under which nursing care or selfcare may occur. Nurses might use administrative decisions, population or aggregate health planning, or policy development to affect health outcomes in this way. Nurses who function in administrative capacities are responsible for direct care provided by other nurses. Their administrative decisions create the conditions under which direct care is provided. Public health nurses organize care for populations or aggregates to create the conditions under which improved health outcomes are more likely to occur. Health policies create broad scale conditions for delivery of nursing and health care (AACN, 2004, 2006; Suby, 2009; Upenieks et al., 2007). \n\nPreparedness: The readiness of the nation’s medical and public health infrastructure to respond to and recover from disasters and public health emergencies. Preparedness requires collaboration with hospitals, healthcare coalitions, biotech firms, community members, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and other partners across the country to improve readiness and response capabilities. \n\nPrimary and secondary data: Primary data is collected by an investigator for a specific purpose. Secondary data is collected by someone else for another purpose (but being utilized by the investigator for another purpose). \n\nProfession: An occupation (e.g., nursing, medicine, law, teaching) that is not mechanical or agricultural and requires special education. \n\nProfessional agility: The power to move quickly and easily; the ability to think and draw conclusions quickly drawing on intellectual acuity. \n\nProfessional development: Taking purposeful action to engage in structured activities to advance \n\ncareer development, education, leadership, program management, and/or compliance initiatives. \n\nProfessional identity: The representation of self, achieved in stages over time during which the characteristics, values, and norms of a profession are internalized, resulting in an individual thinking, acting, and feeling like a member of the profession (Cruess et al., 2014). \n\nQuality Improvement (QI): A process that uses data to monitor the outcomes of care processes. QI uses improvement methods to design and test changes to continuously improve the quality and safety of health care systems (Cronenwett et al., 2007). \n\nResilience: The ability to survive and thrive in the face of adversity. Resilience can be developed and internalized as a measure to improve retention and reduce burnout. Building positive relationships, maintaining positivity, developing emotional insight, creating work-life balance, and reflecting on successes and challenges are effective strategies for resilience building. \n\nResponse and recovery in an emergency/disaster: Identifying resources and expertise in advance and planning how these can be used in a disaster. Preparedness, however, is only one phase of emergency management. There are four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 64 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nResponsibility: The state or fact of being responsible, answerable, or accountable for something within one’s power, control, or management. \n\nReturn on investment (ROI): A performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. ROI seeks to directly measure the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost. To calculate ROI, the benefit (or return) of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment. The result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio. \n\nRisk assessment: A process to identify potential hazards and analyze what could happen if a hazard occurs. To assess risk, organizations often consider possible scenarios that could unfold and what the potential impacts may be. \n\nScholarship: The generation, synthesis, translation, application, and dissemination of knowledge that aims to improve health and transform health care. Scholarship is the communication of knowledge generated through multiple forms of inquiry that inform clinical practice, nursing education, policy, and healthcare delivery. Scholarship is inclusive of discovery, integration, application, and teaching (Boyer, 1990). The hallmark attribute of scholarship is the cumulative impact of the scholar’s work on the field of nursing and health care. \n\nSelf-care: The act of attending to one’s physical or mental health, generally without medical or other professional consultation. \n\nSelf-management: The management of or by oneself; the taking of responsibility for one’s own behavior and well-being. \n\nService: is the action of helping or doing work for someone. \n\nSimulation: A technique that creates a situation or environment to allow persons to experience a representation of a real event for the purpose of practice, learning, evaluation, testing, or to gain understanding of systems or human actions (AHRQ, 2020). \n\nSocial Determinants of Health: See Determinants of Health \n\nSocial Justice: The expectation that everyone deserves equal economic, political, and social rights and opportunities. Equity, access, participation, and human rights are four principles of social justice including to ensure fair distribution of available resources across society, to ensure all people have access to goods and services regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity etc.; to enable people to participate in decisions that affect their lives, and to protect individual liberties to information about circumstances and decisions affecting them and to appeal decisions believed to be unfair (Morgaine, 2014; Nemetchek, 2019). \n\nSocial Responsibility: An ethical theory in which individuals are accountable for fulfilling their civic duty, and the actions of an individual must benefit the whole of society. This typically involves a balance between economic growth and the welfare of society and the environment. (Pachchamama Alliance, 2021) © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 65 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nSpecialty: The pursuit, area of study, or skill to which someone has devoted much time and effort and in which they are expert. Nursing specialization involves focusing on nursing practice in an identified specific area within the discipline of professional nursing. A defined specialty scope of practice statement and standards of professional practice, with accompanying competencies, are unique to each nursing specialty. These documents help assure continued understanding and recognition of nursing’s diverse professional contributions (Finnell, et al, 2015). \n\n• Advanced nursing practice specialties: Currently, advanced nursing practice specialties include informatics, administration/practice leadership, public health/population health, and health policy. Specialties may evolve over time to address future healthcare needs. \n\nSpheres of Care: Encompass the healthcare needs of individuals, families, populations, and the care/services required to address these needs and promote desired health outcomes. In this document, four spheres of care are delineated 1) disease prevention/promotion of health and well-being, which includes the promotion of physical and mental health in all patients as well as management of minor acute and intermittent care needs of generally healthy patients; 2) chronic disease care, which includes management of chronic diseases and prevention of negative sequelae; 3) regenerative or restorative care, which includes critical/trauma care, complex acute care, acute exacerbations of chronic conditions, and treatment of physiologically unstable patients that generally requires care in a mega-acute care institution; and, 4) hospice/ palliative/supportive care which includes end-of-life care as well as palliative and supportive care for individuals requiring extended care or those with complex, chronic disease states or those requiring rehabilitative care (Lipstein, et al, 2016; AACN, 2019). \n\nStandardized data: The process of ensuring that one data set can be compared to other data sets. In statistics, standardized data is the process of putting different variables on the same scale. This process allows one to compare scores between different types of variables. \n\nStress management: A range of strategies to help one better deal with stress and difficulty (adversity). Managing stress can help an individual lead a more balanced, healthier life. Stress is an automatic physical, mental and emotional response to a challenging event. Stress management approaches include learning skills such as problem-solving, prioritizing tasks, and time management to enhance the ability to cope with adversity. \n\nStructural racism: A complex system of conferring social benefits in some groups and imposing burdens on others resulting in segregation, poverty, and denial of opportunity for people of color. Structural racism comprises cultural beliefs, historical legacies, and institutions, policies within and among public and private organizations that interweave to create drastic racial disparities in life outcomes (Wiecek, 2011). \n\nSupport care: Treatment given to prevent, control, or relieve complications and side effects and to improve the patient’s comfort and quality of life. \n\nSystem decision: A computerized program used to support determinations, judgments, and courses of action in an organization or a business. A system decision sifts through and analyzes massive amounts of data, compiling comprehensive information that can be used to solve problems and in decision-making. © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing. All rights reserved. 66 THE ESSENTIALS: CORE COMPETENCIES FOR PROFESSIONAL NURSING EDUCATION \n\nSystemic inequity: A condition where one category of people is attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people. This relationship is perpetuated and reinforced by a confluence of unequal relations in roles, functions, decisions, rights, and opportunities. \n\nSystemic racism (also known as institutionalized racism): Terms similar to structural racism which focuses more on the historical, cultural and social psychological aspects of the currently racialized society. The term institutional racism may be used to differentiate “access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society by race. Institutionalized racism is normative, sometimes legalized, and often manifests as inherited disadvantage. It is structural, having been codified in our institutions of custom, practice, and law, so there is no identifiable perpetrator. Institutionalized racism is often evident as inaction in the face of need” (Jones, 2000). \n\nSystems: A set of elements or components working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network. \n\nSystems-based practice: An analytic tool and a way of viewing the world, which can make caregiving and change efforts more successful. The focus is on understanding the interdependencies of a system or series of systems and the changes identified to improve care that can be made and measured in the system. \n\nTeam-based care: The provision of health services to individuals, families, and/or their communities by at least two health providers who work collaboratively with patients and their caregivers—to the extent preferred by each patient—to accomplish shared goals within and across settings to achieve coordinated, high-quality care (Naylor, 2010; NAM, 2012; AANP, 2020). \n\nTelehealth systems: The use of a technology-based virtual platform to deliver various aspects of health information, prevention, monitoring, and medical care. \n\nTranslation: The process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic, and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public — from diagnostics and therapeutics to medical procedures and behavioral changes. \n\nTranslational science: The field of investigation focused on understanding the scientific and operational principles underlying each step of the translational process. Translational scientists are innovative and collaborative, searching for ways to break down barriers in the translation process and ultimately deliver more treatments to more patients more quickly. \n\nWellness and well-being: A state of being marked by emotional stability (e.g., coping effectively with life and creating satisfying relationships) and physical health (e.g., recognizing the need for physical activity, healthy foods, and sleep). © 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

These domains serve to structure nursing curricula, ensuring that both theoretical knowledge and practical skills are developed in alignment with contemporary healthcare needs.\n\n### Key Domains and Concepts\n\n1. **Knowledge for Nursing Practice**: Integration of nursing knowledge with other disciplines, focusing on evidence-based practice.\n\n2. **Person-Centered Care**: Emphasizes holistic nursing practices that respect individual differences and promote patient involvement in their care.\n\n3. **Population Health**: Involves understanding and improving health outcomes for communities by tackling health disparities.\n\n4. **Scholarship for Nursing Discipline**: Focuses on knowledge generation and dissemination to improve healthcare.\n\n5. **Quality and Safety**: Prioritizes patient safety and quality of care through systematic principles.\n\n6. **Interprofessional Partnerships**: Involves collaboration with a range of health professionals to optimize patient outcomes.\n\n7. **Systems-Based Practice**: Addresses the interaction between multiple health systems to ensure coordinated care.\n\n8. **Informatics and Healthcare Technologies**: Highlights the use of ICT to support nursing practice and improve patient outcomes.\n\n9. **Professionalism**: Involves cultivating a professional identity based on nursing core values.\n\n10. **Personal, Professional, and Leadership Development**: Encourages lifelong learning and the development of leadership skills within the nursing profession.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nThe Essentials framework suggests multiple considerations for effective implementation into nursing education:\n\n- **Competency-Based Education**: Education should focus on mastering specific competencies rather than merely completing courses.\n  \n- **Curriculum Design**: Curricula should be flexible to incorporate innovative teaching strategies and educational technologies, allowing for diverse learning opportunities across clinical settings.\n  \n- **Assessment Methods**: Performance-based assessments are recommended to ensure that students not only learn but can apply their knowledge in real-world situations.\n\n## Implications for Nursing Education\n\nBy adhering to these competencies, nursing programs can prepare graduates who are ready to engage with the diverse challenges of modern healthcare. The use of a competency-based approach is expected to enhance the readiness of nursing graduates to provide high-quality care that meets the complex needs of patients across various settings"
